<h1>BEDSTUCK</h1>
<center>
<p>A silly, gross, and R-rated ludonarrative about cartoon horses.</p>
<p>By <strong>Sean Keith McAuley</strong>, with prompts from a host of other folks.</p>
<p>Version <strong>0.0.3</strong>.</p>
</center>

<h2 style="margin-top: 5em;">ISSUE #1: LU VERSUS THE FILTH</h2>

<p>You are now <dfn>Scootaloo the pony</dfn>. You have <dfn>an aversion to playing choose-your-own-adventure games</dfn>, but luckily this is <dfn>not that kind of game</dfn>. You do <dfn>not get to choose</dfn>.</p>

<p><strong>ENTER A COMMAND.</strong></p>

<p class="prompt">run away</p>
<p>You cannot run; your left leg has been cuffed to the side of your bed.</p>

<p class="prompt">knaw off leg [cheater]</p>
<p>You do not know how to <dfn>knaw</dfn>. Is that something a krow does?</p>
<p>You lean forward, but find out that equines cannot raise their legs in a manner compatible with putting them near their mouths. Also, you can't seem to pull yourself into a sitting position.</p>

<p class="prompt">Look around</p>
<p>You are <dfn>Scootaloo the pony</dfn>. You are in a <dfn>dark room</dfn>, chained to a <dfn>quilted bedspread</dfn> by your <dfn>lower left</dfn> and <dfn>upper right</dfn> hooves. To your left, just out of reach, is a <dfn>nightstand</dfn>. There may be something on the floor out of view. There is a <dfn>wet noise</dfn> coming from through the <dfn>wall</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Quickly retrieve arms from chest.</p>
<p>Your arms are not currently in your chest. Would you like to put them there? [Y/N]</p>

<p class="prompt">N</p>
<p>You put your left arm back down onto the <dfn>bedspread</dfn>. On impact, you notice a <dfn>lump</dfn> under the quilt but above the bedsheets.</p>

<p class="prompt">look at pumpkin</p>
<p>I smell no pumpkin here.</p>

<p class="prompt">cook my brain with my heart</p>
<p>You somehow manage it. You are now Scootaloo the dead pony! <strong>Conglaturation</strong>. You have earned <strong0</strong> out of a possible <strong>Infinity</strong> points. (Undo?)</p>
<p class="prompt"><s>No Thanks, I am Proud Of My Position.</s></p>
<p class="prompt redux">yes</p>
<p>You manage to reverse entropy, and turn a cooked brain-and-heart souffle into separated, renewed pieces. You quickly reattach the requisite nerves and tendons before it's too late.</p>
<p>&hellip;did that really go there? Oops.</p>


<p class="prompt">clopclopclop</p>
<p>You reach your left arm down between your thighs and try slapping it loudly against your vulva. Sadly, only a small squishing noise is made. Your attempt to call for help has failed.</p>

<p class="prompt">check inventory</p>
<p>You currently are in possession of a <dfn>rainbow-maned plug</dfn> (location vague), and <dfn>ugly red stains</dfn> covering your face. They have been traced into the shape of the letters "H" and "A."</p>

<p class="prompt">Day dream about the wet noise</p>
<p>The <dfn>noise</dfn>. You hear it most nights. It's almost comforting now. It could lull you into&hellip;</p>
<p>[Time passes.]</p>
<p>You awake with a start, and try leaning forward, but the chain resists your arousal. You turn and collapse on your side.</p>
<p>You notice a <dfn>small shiny thing</dfn> on the floor below the bed.</p>

<p class="prompt">examine the lump under the quilt but above the bedsheets</p>
<p>You slide your hoof around the edges of the crease on the quilt. The lump feels flat, rectangular, hard, perhaps metallic. You tap it with your hooftip and a hollow noise is produced, a bit like a plastic container.</p>



<p class="prompt">Examine anal cavity for clues [lolwut]</p>
<p>You reach behind yourself, feeling between your legs. You find a soft, plush length of horsehair.</p>
<p>&hellip;that's just your tail.</p>
<p>You reach further down, and find a coarser, slightly-moist length of hair. You try pulling it out, but you can't seem to get a grip on it with your <dfn>lack of opposable thumbs</dfn>.</p>

<div class="aside">
  <blockquote class="author">
    <p>By the way, in a Doug Adams story, the correct solution would be:</p>
    <p class="prompt" style="margin-top: 1em;">drop lack of opposable thumbs</p>
  </blockquote>
</div>

<p class="prompt">do the above</p>
<p>You don't know what <dfn>thumbs</dfn> are, but you are certain that if they were <dfn>opposed</dfn>, you wouldn't want to stand between them. Perhaps they are best left to their mutual enmity?</p>

<p class="prompt">try to remember what happened last night</p>
<p>You know what happened last night. Sadly, <dfn>the player</dfn> does not.</p>

<p class="prompt">tell the player what happened last night</p>
<p>You go on a long speel about the events of the previous night, making lots of arm-waving motions, air-humps, and slightly-overacted moans. Sadly, none of the actual words are comprehensible. They will be rendered in the transcript as <dfn>horse sounds</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">be slightly embarassed</p>
<p>You are now slightly embarrassed.</p>
<p>You have gained <strong>+1 point(s)</strong> on your <dfn>patheticness meter</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Examine the nightstand</p>
<p>The <dfn>nightstand</dfn> is a dark, polished wooden rectangle from this angle. On it, you can see your <dfn>obsolete piece-of-junk computer</dfn> (the one whose logo appears similar to Big Macintosh's rear), its screen reflecting a shard of light escaping from the <dfn>ajar door</dfn> on the far side of the room.</p>

<p class="prompt">Attempt to hoof the small shiny thing over from under the bed.</p>
<p>You reach down with your upper-left hoof, but cannot get close enough to the <dfn>small shiny thing</dfn> to even touch it.</p>
<p>You reach down with your lower-left hoof, and manage to roll the <dfn>small shiny thing</dfn> toward you. It is now the <dfn>small shiny cylinder</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">smell air with your enhanced equine senses.</p>
<p>The air smells of sex, and a definite lack of pumpkins. Because it is, in fact, the morning after Nightmare Night, you find the latter development rather startling.</p>

<p class="prompt">get the narrator to tell the player what happened last night</p>
<p>The narrator refuses to help Lu with any actions that are not in the narrator's best interests.</p>

<p class="prompt">flip-off narrator</p>
<p>You, <dfn>the player</dfn>, are now in the <strong>Land of Stumps and Shame</strong>. Sadly, you can no longer issue commands, as you are no longer sitting in front of a computer terminal. Undo? [impossible]</p>

<p class="prompt">Manage the impossible</p>
<p>Okay, fine. But only if you say you're sorry.</p>

<p class="prompt">sorry</p>
<p>You, <dfn>the player</dfn>, are now playing the game of <dfn>Sorry&trade;</dfn>, by <dfn>Milton-Bradley</dfn>. After several rounds, you manage to wake up <dfn>the parents</dfn>, causing you to be <dfn>very sorry</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Examine chains</p>
<p>The <dfn>chains</dfn> are iron shackles of the kind miss Pinkamina prefers. However, they're unusually clean compared to their appearance after one of her usual sessions. This may be because miss Pinkamina was not their user. It also might be because somepony meticulously scrubbed them clean while you were sleeping. You never know.</p>

<p class="prompt">Use your computer to stream live video of your compromising position to the Ponynet</p>
<p>You cannot reach your <dfn>obsolete piece-of-junk</dfn>, and even if you could, it is currently <dfn>off</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Convince the narrator that showing the player what happened is in his best interests.</p>
<p>Lu, despite being unable to speak to <dfn>the player</dfn> in any comprehensible manner, informs them that <dfn>the narrator</dfn> should be convinced of things through <dfn>showing</dfn>, not <dfn>telling</dfn>.</p>

<p><dfn>the narrator</dfn> does not want to type any sort of <dfn>long</dfn>, <dfn>affected infodump</dfn> at this point, so any attempts to <dfn>convince</dfn> him would be pointless. On the other hand, <dfn>small pieces of information may be requested through the help service</dfn>. They will cost <dfn>one bit of negentropy</dfn> each.</p>

<p class="prompt">help: What the heck is a bit of negentropy? And how many do I have?</p>

<p><strong>HELP</strong> &ndash; topic: <dfn>negentropy</dfn></p>
<p>Negentropy is the force in the universe resisting entropy&mdash;the thermodynamic decay of particles into pure, non-kinetic heat. Negentropy is also known as information, and can be measured in bits. Negentropy is the source of new universes. It is also a deliberate allusion to the fact that Homestuck basically uses this concept but calls it Grist.</p>

<p class="prompt">Stop being an idioiot and learn to cpell XD</p>

<p>You (Lu) learns the verb <dfn>cpell</dfn>. Try it. Go on.</p>

<p class="prompt">cpell the chains</p>
<p>You try to <dfn>cpell</dfn> the chains, but you realize that <dfn>cpell</dfn> is, in fact, an intransitive verb, chucklefuck.</p>

<p class="prompt">fcuk speling</p>
<p>You <dfn>fcuk speling</dfn> right in the butt. There are no consequences, but you feel slightly more relaxed.</p>
<p>You have <dfn>lost</dfn> 1 <dfn>patheticness</dfn> point.</p>

<p class="prompt">request assistance</p>
<p>You try <dfn>clopping</dfn> again. It still doesn't do anything useful.</p>

<p class="prompt">vocalize</p>
<p>"Neeeeeeiiiiiiigh."</p>

<p class="prompt">realize this is A bad idea, given your compromising situation</p>
<p>You <dfn>realize</dfn> that <dfn>vocalizing</dfn> might make Miss Pinkamina come into the room and see what a <dfn>horribly embarrassing entanglement</dfn> you have entered into without her knowledge. You silence yourself resignedly.</p>
<p>+2 to <dfn>patheticness</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">wonder how you got up to this without miss pinkamena noticing</p>
<p>Miss Pinkamina is very, very distracted making the <dfn>wet noise</dfn> that is coming through the wall.</p>
<p>She won't stop for anything&hellip; and if she did, she would be <dfn>very angry and sexually frustrated</dfn>, a combination that, despite <dfn>definite viewer appeal</dfn>, you would <dfn>prefer to avoid</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Wonder who Pionkamena is</p>
<p>Pionkamena is a stuffed toy miss Pinkamina used to have. It had many adventures involving <dfn>time paradoxes</dfn>, and eventually was renamed <dfn>smartypants</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Move zig</p>
<p>You roll the <dfn>small shiny cylinder</dfn> again with your lower-right hoof, until you find that it is labelled with the words <strong>Zig-Zag Co.</strong> It appears to be a cylindrical fire-starting apparatus.</p>

<p class="prompt">cpell on the floor.</p>
<p>You aim your <dfn>cpell</dfn> at the floor. This is fine, since "on the floor" is not, in fact, a direct object, but rather a locative subclause, and can sometimes be ignored when inapplicable.</p>

<p><strong>CPELL:</strong> Your <dfn>cpell</dfn> gauge currently reads "0.5 baud".</p>

<p class="prompt">Wonder what the hay a cpell gague is.</p>
<p>You have no idea either. It is apparently a piece of information recited to <dfn>the player</dfn> by an informative help text, but which must be activated by Lu.</p>

<p class="prompt">Flail</p>
<p>You <dfn>whip your hair back and forth</dfn>. It causes your <dfn>neck</dfn> to become <dfn>slightly sore</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">help:  cpell gauge</p>

<p><strong>HELP</strong> &ndash; topic: <dfn>cpell gauge</dfn></p>
<p>The Cpell Gague is similar to a Spell Gauge, but with some artieacts introduced. Thus, it requires both a form of <dfn>mp</dfn> (bits of negentropy) and artifacts (material spell components.)</p>

<p class="prompt">realize that cpell is not A word, but an acronym for Chicagoland Partners for English Language Learners</p>

<p>Lu realizes this. Sadly, she is alone in this <dfn>oddly prescient</dfn> knowledge.</p>

<p class="prompt">wonder what the heck the Chicagoland Partners for English Language Learners is</p>

<p>The  Chicagoland Partners for English Language Learners is an organization established in 1322 in the Equestrian subdistrict of Chicagoland, aimed at teaching the archaic language of English, introduced by Princess Celestia as the new royal tongue. It is also the <dfn>bonus boss</dfn> of this game&hellip; according to Lu.</p>

<p class="prompt">Use the small shiny cylinder to set fire to the quilt</p>
<p>You still cannot <dfn>pick up</dfn> the <dfn>small shiny cylinder</dfn>. You really are beginning to understand what <dfn>miss Lyra Heartstrings</dfn> sees in <dfn>opposable thumbs</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">wonder what your goal is</p>
<p>You <dfn>wonder</dfn> this. You <dfn>wonder</dfn> it a long time. You <dfn>do not have the answer</dfn>. Few ponies do, really.</p>

<p class="prompt">xyzzy, and if that doesn't work, plover</p>
<p>An <dfn>orange cloud</dfn> suddenly appears in the room! It disappates, leaving behind the <dfn>smell of pumpkins</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Pull the quilt off of the bed</p>
<p>Twisting and moving your weight from one point to another, you manage to pull the <dfn>quilt</dfn> out from underneath you and push it into the corner of the bed. You cannot pull it fully off, because the <dfn>chains</dfn> are blocking the way.</p>

<p>You have revealed the <dfn>glossy non-obsolete computing device</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">aquire the glossy non-obsolete computing device.</p>
<p>You (somehow) manage to <dfn>pick up</dfn> the <dfn>glossy non-obsolete computing device</dfn> with your upper-left hoof. You rest it on your <dfn>supple stomach-fuzz</dfn> and <dfn>stare</dfn> at it for a few moments. Nothing happens. The screen is off.</p>

<p class="prompt">Look for floss. Recognize importance of dental hygine</p>
<div class="aside">
  <blockquote class="player-a">
    <p>Who needs floss when you can brush your teeth with two big ol futa dicks</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote class="player-b">
    <p>Scootaloo &ne; Colgate</p>
  </blockquote>
</div>
<p>You would love to <dfn>floss</dfn>, if you could reach the bathroom. You still feel a few <dfn>stray hairs</dfn> caught between your teeth.</p>

<p class="prompt">Autoerotically combust.</p>
<p>Your <dfn>frustgruntlement gauge</dfn> is not at a high enough level to perform any <dfn>acts of man-chested magnificence</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">look for key to unlock the chains</p>
<p>You look. Hay, what do you know! The key was in your mouth the whole time!</p>
<p>&hellip;no, not really. You are starting to wonder if you might have <dfn>swallowed</dfn> it last night. She did put it in your mouth&hellip;</p>

<p class="prompt">thinks about the pony that put the key in your mouth, being sure to use the pony's name in your thoughts</p>
<p>You <dfn>think</dfn> about her. You think <dfn>long</dfn> and <dfn>hard</dfn>, including her <dfn>sexy name</dfn>, which is heard quite clearly in the depths of your <dfn>mental landscape</dfn>, but which obviously cannot escape your <dfn>musty brainpan</dfn>.</p>
<p>Your <dfn>frustgruntlement</dfn> gague goes up by <strong>two inches</strong>!</p>

<p class="prompt">Ponder about the life lessons taught by quantum mechanics</p>
<p>You ponder. Then you look down, and wonder if you have been here before.</p>

<p class="prompt">Ponder about the life lessons taught by quantum mechanics again</p>
<p>You ponder again. Then you look up.</p>

<p class="prompt">Presume.</p>
<p>You presume. Seguellogysm chain: [<code class="promptref">Presume</code> | &hellip;]</p>

<p class="prompt">Pontificate.</p>
<p>You pontificate. Seguellogysm chain: [<code class="promptref">Pontificate</code> | [<code class="promptref">Presume</code> | &hellip;]]</p>

<p class="prompt">Defenestrate.</p>
<p>You defenestrate. Seguellogysm chain. [<code class="promptref">Defenestrate</code> | [<code class="promptref">Pontificate</code> | [<code class="promptref">Presume</code> | &hellip;]]]</p>

<p class="prompt">Activate seguellogysm chain on chain</p>
<p>You activate the <dfn>seg</dfn>&ndash;something or other. Honestly the mechanics of this game are ludicrous, and you feel bad for the people playing it. Nonetheless, you manage to somehow <dfn>presume</dfn> that the chain might come unchained at some point in the future, <dfn>pontificate</dfn> the end of the chain to make it sharp enough to cut something with, and <dfn>defenestrate</dfn> it through the bedside window, which, although previously un-noted, was <dfn>slightly open enough</dfn> to allow it through. The <dfn>sharpened chain</dfn> plants itself firmly in your <dfn>window garden</dfn>.</p>
<p>Of course, this all happened only in your mind, due to the <dfn>presumption</dfn> at the beginning of the <dfn>syllogysm</dfn>, but nonetheless it somehow also occurs in reality, due to a convenient <dfn>segue</dfn>.</p>

<p>There. That is how you use the <dfn>seguellogysm</dfn>. No tutorial this time or anything. (Phew)</p>

<p class="prompt">check cpell component pouch</p>
<p>You do not have a <dfn>cpell component pouch</dfn>. You have a <dfn>mysterious feeling</dfn> that <dfn>cpells</dfn> just use <dfn>whatever is around</dfn> to do their thing. Whatever that thing is.</p>

<p class="prompt">help:  patheticness:  uses.</p>

<p><strong>HELP</strong> &ndash; topic: <dfn>patheticness</dfn></p>
<p>See: <dfn>the player</dfn></p>

<p class="prompt">Get some ice for that sick burn</p>
<p>You realize that your <dfn>leg</dfn> is now free from the <dfn>bed</dfn>. However, you also realize that your <dfn>leg</dfn> is now instead shackled to the <dfn>window garden</dfn>. This may be different, but it is not necessarily better.</p>

<p class="prompt">&#x25B2;</p>
<p>&#x25B2; &#x25B2; Tryforce</p>

<p class="prompt">practice several pick up lines to use on miss pinkamina</p>
<p>You think that miss Pinkamina would quite likely have sex with you if you so much as said the word nearby her. But you aren't that kind of gal, and she knows it. You'd rather be lifted off your hooves rather slowly.</p>

<p class="prompt">rub supple stomach-fuzz erotically</p>
<p>You pet yourself. Heavily. It is heavy petting. Haw haw.</p>
<p><dfn>frustgruntlement</dfn> <strong>+1inch</strong> (now at <strong>3"</strong>)</p>

<p class="prompt">(&#9583;&#3232;_&#3232;&#65289;&#9583; &#9531;&#9473;&#9531;</p>
<p>You reach over, and push the <dfn>window garden</dfn> gently off its metal ledge insets. It topples mercelessly (yet somehow silently) to the ground below. You feel a sudden tug as the <dfn>sharpened chain</dfn> gets pulled downward along with it, and almost rise off the <dfn>bed</dfn> as you are <dfn>drawn</dfn> apart as if by some sort of <dfn>medieval equines</dfn>. (wot?) However, the <dfn>window garden</dfn> snaps off the end of the <dfn>chain</dfn> when <dfn>harsh mistress gravity</dfn> beckons it forth, and the <dfn>chain</dfn> releases its tug against you. Your <dfn>leg</dfn> is now free.</p>

<p class="prompt">Pull aggro on window garden weeds</p>
<p>You should have thought of that sooner. They're down there, mixed with all the other weeds on the <dfn>left side</dfn> of the house.</p>

<p class="prompt">Dryrot.</p>

<p><strong>SG</strong>: (<code class="promptref">Dryrot</code> <code class="promptref">Crumble</code>)</p>

<p class="prompt">Collapse seguellogysm on window garden</p>
<p>You fire the Seguellogysm, but it fizzles when it reaches the window. Seguellogysms only work within your <dfn>empathic belief field</dfn>!</p>

<p class="prompt">investigate. contribute. rejoice. and satisfy.</p>
<p><strong>SG</strong>: (<code class="promptref">Investigate</code> <code class="promptref">Contribute</code> <code class="promptref">Rejoice</code> <code class="promptref">Satisfy</code>)</p>

<p class="prompt">Collapse seguellogysm on wet noise</p>
<p>You fire the Seguellogysm at the <dfn>wet noise</dfn> which is currently <dfn>reaching your ears from within the room</dfn>, <dfn>after having travelled through the wall</dfn>. You realize as you do this that <dfn>this is</dfn> A <dfn>total cop-out on the part of the narrator</dfn>, but you proceed nevertheless. The <dfn>wet noise</dfn> is <dfn>investigate</dfn>d, causing it to be discovered to be a <dfn>pink noise</dfn>. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_noise ) You then <dfn>contribute</dfn> to it by rubbing the two <dfn>chain</dfn>s together, simulating a 1/f noise. You <dfn>rejoice</dfn> as your ears burn from the <dfn>atrocious racket</dfn> this creates. However, you still feel <dfn>satisfied</dfn>.</p>

<p>The only real effect of this is that your <dfn>frustgruntlement gauge</dfn> has dropped back down to zero. That's what you get for satisfying yourself!</p>

<p class="prompt">player: Use the Ponynet to look up a walkthrough or strategy guide for the game</p>
<p><dfn>the player</dfn> doesn't want to go to the Land of Stumps and Shame again, does he? (Y/N)</p>

<p>Good. That's what I thought.</p>

<p><strong>SG</strong>: (<code class="promptref">Reduce</code> <code class="promptref">Reuse</code> <code class="promptref">Recycle</code>)</p>

<p class="prompt">Collapse seguellogysm on non-combustables.</p>
<p>The <dfn>non-combustable obsolete piece-of-junk</dfn> is <dfn>reduced</dfn> to a <dfn>non-combustable obsolete pile-of-rubble</dfn> by a good whack with the <dfn>iron chain</dfn> attached firmly to your leg. (You're quite good at whipping that thing around, as it turns out.) You <dfn>reuse</dfn> the <dfn>pile-of-rubble</dfn> to form a new, smaller, <dfn>obsolete piece-of-junk</dfn>. You then <dfn>recycle</dfn> it by throwing it out the window, where you know there sits a large blue bin.</p>

<p>The narrator wishes to point out that you are using seguellogysms to do things that are entirely possible without them. Though you can keep going, if you want. I personally tend to jump and spin-dash far more than is useful in action-adventure games, myself.</p>

<p class="prompt">player: octavia suggests stupid, nonsenical inventory management that does not require any sort of consistency in either management or contents</p>

<p>The narrator abides by <strong>Player: Octavia</strong>'s suggestion, because <strong>Ace2401</strong> and <strong>LordTristan</strong>'s votes cancel out. Thus:</p>

<p class="prompt">Player: Ace2401 inquires: But what about the wording of the below? Wouldn't that cancel Octavia's suggestion?</p>

<p>The narrator reminds the players that only the narrator's wording has any applicability to the shape and form of the space-time continuum. Everyone else is just talkin' words.</p>


<p class="prompt">use freed legs to lever out rainbow-maned plug</p>

<p class="prompt">you didn't mind last night</p>
<p>Well, last night it felt clean and fresh and lubricated, and the pain was conflicted with pleasure as other things were inserted in other <dfn>vague places</dfn>.

<p class="prompt">player: Ace2401 inquires: Why do you insist on using the phrase vague places when everyone knows it means certain orfices? </p>
<p>Lu has a renewed interest in the species of objects to which <dfn>opposable thumbs</dfn> belong. Specifically, she wants the all important <dfn>middle finger</dfn> she has heard so much about.</p>
<p>Lu's <dfn>patheticness</dfn> and <dfn>frustgruntlement</dfn> gagues both go up, by <strong>+1</strong> and <strong>+1"</strong> respectively. It is a <strong>desperation combo</strong>.</p>

<p class="prompt">player Ace2401 Laughs out loud, but then apoligizes for any offense he may have caused. </p>

<p class="prompt">help: Using the frustgruntlement gauge.</p>

<p><strong>HELP</strong> &ndash; topic: <dfn>frustgruntlement</dfn></p>
<p>The <dfn>frustgruntlement</dfn> gauge measures how <strong>frustrated</strong> and <strong>disgruntled</strong> Lu is with her current situation. When it reaches <strong>maximum power</strong>, Lu can have a <code class="promptref">breakdown</code> of <strong>angry moody problems</strong> stemming from <strong>childhood</strong>.

<p>About <code class="promptref">squeeze out plug</code>: You push a little, and it pops right out. You roll it over to your side, then pause for a moment as you feel a damp, slightly muddy rush of <dfn>vagueness</dfn> come up from behind it. You do not wish to think further on that.</p>
<p><dfn>Patheticness</dfn> <strong>+5</strong>.</p>

<p class="prompt">examine chain constraining upper right leg</p>
<p>The chain is shackled to your arm quite tightly at the elbow, cutting off your cirulation and not allowing you very much <dfn>freedom of movement</dfn> at all. It seems to require a <dfn>small key</dfn> to be unlocked from the <dfn>mounting point on the bed</dfn>.</p>

<p>Tears and bile stream down your face in equal amounts. You seem to have vomited recently, as this taste is similar to that which was already in your mouth. Thus, virtually nothing comes up.</p>

<p>Your <dfn>patheticness</dfn> is now on <strong>overload</strong>. You <strong>cry like a little foal</strong>.</p>

<p class="prompt">lash out at the players</p>
<p>In a fit of <strong>adorable-yet-painful pathos</strong>, you weakly throw your <dfn>hooves</dfn> around, banging them softly on the <dfn>bedspread</dfn> and slightly <strong>painfully</strong> on the <dfn>iron bed supports</dfn>. You are throwing a <strong>tantrum</strong> like you are a <strong>five-year-old</strong>. It feels&hellip; <strong>good</strong>.</p>
<p>After a while, you stop and catch your breath. Your left arm is now <dfn>sore</dfn>.</p>
<p>Your <dfn>patheticness</dfn> <em>decreases</em> by <strong>5</strong>.</p>

<p class="prompt">execute level one desperation technique: half-hearted tug on aforementioned chain</p>
<p>You <code class="promptref">tug</code> on the <dfn>chain</dfn> in as <strong>meek</strong> a manner as is possible while still causing your arm to move at all.

<p>After a few minutes, the <dfn>wet noise</dfn> outside your room has stopped&mdash;but you cannot notice this, because there is now an equally-loud <dfn>wet noise</dfn> coming from your own immediate vicinity.

<p class="prompt">tell miss pinkamina you'll be with her in  moment</p>
<p>You open your mouth equine noises come out, and miss Pinkamina responds with other equine noises.

Still, being a <dfn>good and naive friend</dfn>, she <dfn>allows you to continue your manic spiel</dfn> on the benefits of <dfn>letting</dfn> A <dfn>seemingly-crazed</dfn> and <dfn>MAJIKK-drunk girl</dfn> into her <dfn>home</dfn> to be <dfn>naked</dfn> under <dfn>water</dfn>.</p>

<p><dfn>anything</dfn> can be made to sound <dfn>alienating</dfn> with the right <dfn>perspective</dfn>. She just lets you in like it ain't no thang.</p>

<p class="prompt">Use shower, become clean.</p>
<p>You <dfn>encounter</dfn> a wild <dfn>rarity</dfn>. (Oh Shiz) Her eyes take you in. Your level of <dfn>filth</dfn>. <dfn>filth</dfn>.</p>
<p><dfn>filth</dfn>.</p>
<p>She somehow manages to <dfn>vaporize</dfn> you with her <dfn>hate</dfn>.</p>

<p>Undo blah blah blah.</p>

<p>You are back <dfn>outside</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt question">Does Lu have the <dfn>MAJIKKtricity</dfn> required to <dfn>thunderwool rarity</dfn>?</p>
<p>The <dfn>emmmmmm peeeeees</dfn> were expended in the <dfn>cpellkasting</dfn>. Lu could probably <dfn>thunderwool sweetie belle</dfn>&hellip; but even <dfn>Spike</dfn> could <dfn>thunderwool sweetie belle</dfn>. And his <dfn>patheticness</dfn> is <dfn>maximum</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">create disguise out of acquired filth</p>
<p>(This is probably now a good idea.)</p>
<p>Using <dfn>sweetie belle</dfn> as a <dfn>spotter</dfn>, you <dfn>move your filth around</dfn> such that you appear to be an <dfn>inanimate object</dfn>. You are not sure what <dfn>kind</dfn> of <dfn>inanimate object</dfn> you appear to be, but you suppose that it might be an <dfn>orange coat</dfn> of some sort.</p>
<p>Sadly, your body has no trace of <dfn>orange</dfn> left, and you appear to be a <dfn>large</dfn>, <dfn>hardened blob of santorum</dfn>. You are glad that the <dfn>narrator</dfn> usually used the word <dfn>vagueness</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt question">Does the bathroom have a window?</p>
<p>No. It is one of those horrible bathrooms that get <dfn>damper</dfn> the longer you stay within them. It is a wonder that <dfn>rarity</dfn> manages to look the way she does.</p>

<p class="prompt">sneak past Rarity to reach the bathroom</p>
<p>You <dfn>enter</dfn> the house. A <dfn>wild rarity approaches</dfn>&hellip; and promptly <dfn>faints</dfn> after seeing the <dfn>face of her nightmares standing before her</dfn>. You <dfn>enter</dfn> the <dfn>bathroom</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Baricade the door</p>
<p>You reach to <dfn>barricade</dfn> the <dfn>door</dfn>, but <dfn>sweetie belle</dfn> has already <dfn>stepped inside with you</dfn>. Do you continue? (Y/N)</p>

<p class="prompt">no, but ask sweetie belle to gaurd the bathroom from wild rarities</p>
<p>The <dfn>narrator humbly posits</dfn> that <dfn>sweetie belle</dfn> is the <dfn>worst guard ever</dfn>, because of her high <dfn>imagination stat blatanlty stolen from problem sleuth</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">politely Ask sweetie belle to leave the bathroom </p>
<p><dfn>sweetie belle insists</dfn> that she wants to <dfn>stay</dfn>, and perhaps to <dfn>help you clean yourself</dfn>. You have <dfn>no idea why</dfn> this would rank anywhere within her <dfn>desires</dfn>, especially given how <dfn>horribly filthy</dfn> you are at this moment. If you were anyone other than you at this moment, you would rather <dfn>nuke you from orbit</dfn> than touch you.</p>


<p class="prompt">ask if sweetie belle wants to sex you to death in the shower</p>
<p><dfn>sweetie belle</dfn> is <dfn>incapable</dfn> of <dfn>using any verb</dfn> with the <dfn>subordinate clause</dfn> "<dfn>to death</dfn>." Her <dfn>frustgruntlement</dfn> is <dfn>always at minimum</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">baricade door to prevent wild rarities from intruding into the bathroom</p>
<p><dfn>you barricade the door</dfn> with the massive assortment of <dfn>hair products</dfn> that the <dfn>wild rarity</dfn> obviously keeps stocked in every possible cranny of the <dfn>bathroom</dfn>. They make a pile higher than the <dfn>bathroom door</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Wile keeping your gaurd up in case of anything that may kill you, use the shower to become clean. in case of impending death or rape, run like hell</p>
<p>You begin to <dfn>clean</dfn> yourself. <dfn>sweetie belle</dfn> steps into the <dfn>shower</dfn> and <dfn>helps</dfn>, in a surprisingly pleasant and <dfn>not altogether removed from</dfn>, <dfn>but also not entirely</dfn>, <dfn>sexual</dfn> manner. You feel both <dfn>clean</dfn> and <dfn>aroused</dfn>. <dfn>sweetie belle</dfn>, however, is now slightly <dfn>filthy</dfn>.</p>

<p>+500 points for <dfn>cleanliness</dfn>.</p>
<p>+3 points for <dfn>class-s relationship</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">thank sweetie belle, and return home</p>
<p>You <dfn>thank sweetie belle</dfn>, but she looks <dfn>extremely disappointed</dfn>. You guess that she expected you to <dfn>clean your filth off her body</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">decide to stay and return the favour since nothing seems to be killing or raping Scootaloo</p>
<p>You <dfn>clean sweetie belle</dfn>, but you just get <dfn>filthy</dfn> again. Then <dfn>she</dfn> cleans <dfn>you</dfn>&hellip; it just seems to be <dfn>passing back and forth</dfn>, <dfn>forever</dfn>.</p>
<p>[Time passes.]</p>
<p>You realize that there was no <dfn>window</dfn> in this room, and that you thoroughly <dfn>barricaded</dfn> the door. You are having a lot of trouble <dfn>breathing</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">let in fresh air</p>
<p>You <dfn>topple the cans and open the door</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">close the door again after getting fresh air into the bathroom</p>
<p>A <dfn>wild rarity</dfn> manages to <dfn>rush into the room</dfn>. She seems to have been <dfn>camping</dfn> the <dfn>door</dfn> like some sort of <dfn>nub</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">run like hell</p>
<p>Why? You are no longer <dfn>filthy</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">belay the last command, but keep your gaurd up</p>

<p>The <dfn>wild rarity</dfn> spies the <dfn>currently-filthy sweetie belle</dfn>. The <dfn>wild rarity hulks out</dfn>. The <dfn>wild rarity</dfn> is now the <dfn>fifty-foot wild rarity</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt question">Is now a good time to <dfn>run like hell</dfn>?</p>

<p>Yes. The <dfn>fifty-foot wild rarity</dfn> puts <dfn>two and two together</dfn> and realizes that you have taken her sister's <dfn>vagueginity</dfn>, because of how <dfn>vague</dfn> she currently is. She <dfn>gives chase</dfn> at a rate of <dfn>fifty feet</dfn> per <dfn>foot</dfn>. As in, every time you put down your little <dfn>hoof</dfn>, she puts down a big, ugly, dragon-like <dfn>foot</dfn>. You didn't realize that <dfn>hulking out</dfn> did that.</p>

<p class="prompt">run like hell and dodge giant feet</p>
<p>You <dfn>do so</dfn>. The <dfn>wild rarity</dfn> tries to <dfn>gnab</dfn> you, but it seems that her <dfn>aim</dfn> has been deleteriously affected by her <dfn>hulk-out</dfn>. She merely swings her <dfn>meaty fists</dfn> around like a <dfn>damn dirty ape</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">go to twilight's library</p>
<p>You arrive at the <dfn>library</dfn> and <dfn>fast-talk</dfn> your way <dfn>inside</dfn>. You realize that <dfn>sweetie belle</dfn> has been <dfn>chasing you</dfn> this whole time, trusting your <dfn>judgement</dfn> for a good place to hide from her <dfn>scary sister</dfn>. Do you let her in? (Y/N)</p>

<p class="prompt">yes</p>
<p>You allow your <dfn>filthy friend</dfn> into the <dfn>clean</dfn>, <dfn>quiet</dfn>, and <dfn>well-kept library</dfn>. You see <dfn>twilight sparkle pony</dfn> sitting on a chair in a somewhat <dfn>humorous</dfn> position, reading a large and undoubtedly <dfn>boring</dfn> book. She sees <dfn>you</dfn> as well, and&hellip; seems to not give even the slightest <dfn>fuck</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Explain the situation to twilight and Spike, and politely ask to use the bathroom</p>
<p>Twilight nods. Twilight goes back to <dfn>reading</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">find A way to get both sweetie belle and Scootaloo clean</p>
<p>You manage to <dfn>put two and two together</dfn> as well, and realize that somehow the grime covering both you and <dfn>sweetie belle</dfn> has somehow become <dfn>MAJIKKal</dfn> in nature. It seems it requires a <dfn>MAJIKKal intercession</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">ask twilight for help with the MAJIKKal filth.</p>
<p><dfn>twilight sparkle pony</dfn> has a very hard time <dfn>paying attention</dfn> to your <dfn>request</dfn>. It seems like she is just barely <dfn>attuned</dfn> to this <dfn>plane of existence</dfn> to <dfn>begin with</dfn>. Or maybe she's just <dfn>high</dfn>. Either way, after you <dfn>finish</dfn>, she nods. And does nothing.</p>

<p class="prompt">wonder why rainbow dash's vagueness is so MAJIKKal.</p>
<p>You would <dfn>wonder</dfn> this, but you realize that <dfn>doing so</dfn> would leave it <dfn>less up to interpretation</dfn> as to who you had <dfn>vague relations</dfn> with <dfn>last night</dfn>. That <dfn>plug notwithstanding</dfn>, because <dfn>you have always owned that thing</dfn>. You <dfn>made it yourself</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt comment"><dfn>keeps assuming</dfn> that the <dfn>vagueness</dfn> that took place last night was with <dfn>rainbow dash</dfn>, as that was a <dfn>suspiciously specific denail</p>
<p>Because <dfn>the narrator</dfn> can tell <dfn>what you are on about</dfn>, <dfn>player</dfn>: Ace2401.</p>
<p class="prompt comment">XD</p>

<p class="prompt">Release sexual tension with sweetie belle in the bathroom where it's private.</p>
<p>You <dfn>do it</dfn> with your <dfn>friend</dfn>. This makes you feel <dfn>dirty</dfn> in a <dfn>completely different way</dfn> than you are <dfn>used to</dfn>. But you imagine it will be <dfn>okay</dfn>, <dfn>eventually</dfn>.</p>

<p>Now you are <dfn>both filthy</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">take showers togehter again</p>
<p><dfn>twilight sparkle pony'</dfn>s shower does no better at <dfn>cleaning</dfn> you off in your <dfn>mutual grime</dfn> than the <dfn>wild rarity'</dfn>s did. You wonder what happened to the <dfn>wild rarity</dfn>, anyway. She's probably still <dfn>outside</dfn> or something.</p>

<p class="prompt question">Has some of the <dfn>filth</dfn> been <dfn>removed</dfn> by the <dfn>shower</dfn>?</p>
<p>Some of the <dfn>filth</dfn> has now been pushed <dfn>inside</dfn> your <dfn>vagueness</dfn> by the <dfn>vigorous vagueing together</dfn>. That's <dfn>gross</dfn>. But it's <dfn>less visible</dfn>, at least&hellip; no. That's just <dfn>gross</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Check and see if twilight is less high/more attunded to the real world yet. </p>
<p><dfn>twilight sparkle pony</dfn> seems to be <dfn>coming down</dfn> a bit. You re-attempt to tell her of your <dfn>plight</dfn>. She giggles and points her hoof at your face, and says that the <dfn>MAJIKKX</dfn> making up your <dfn>atomic nuclei</dfn> are currently doing something-or-other a <dfn>prime number</dfn> of <dfn>times per second</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">ask twilight if she can help.</p>
<p>Why don't you ask <dfn>Spike</dfn>? <dfn>Spike</dfn> isn't <dfn>high</dfn>. <dfn>Spike</dfn> is just <dfn>pathetic</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Reallocate filth to Spike, where everyone is used to seeing filth anyway</p>
<p>This is an <dfn>incredibly good idea</dfn>. Sadly, <dfn>Spike</dfn> already has <dfn>maximum filth</dfn> as well.</p>

<p class="prompt">ask Spike for help</p>
<p>You ask <dfn>Spike</dfn> to tell <dfn>twilight sparkle pony</dfn> of your <dfn>plight</dfn> for you, since, having lived with her for his entire life, he may just know a way of getting through to her that you, <dfn>Loki</dfn>, in your <dfn>dull-minded absenteeism</dfn>, never ventured toward.</p>

<p><dfn>Spike</dfn> waddles over to <dfn>twilight sparkle pony</dfn>, and <dfn>kicks her off of her chair</dfn>. <dfn>twilight</dfn> looks up at him <dfn>blearily</dfn> from the <dfn>floor</dfn>, and begins to <dfn>wail quietly</dfn>, apparently at something that <dfn>isn't there</dfn>.</p>

<p><dfn>Spike</dfn> shakes his <dfn>head</dfn>.</p>

<p>He does, however, bring you a <dfn>book</dfn>. It is the <dfn>book of dumb fabric</dfn>, that <dfn>may be familiar to some of you</dfn> from <dfn>another story</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Spike: Offer to trade a quantity of mundane filth for Lu's swanky accumulation of magical filth</p>
<p>Spike says that his filth is <dfn>plenty MAJIKKal</dfn>. He got it from the <dfn>ew monsters</dfn> on the <dfn>elemental plane of degradation</dfn>.</p>


<p class="prompt">look for a cure to the filth in thiis book</p>
<p>You <dfn>look</dfn> at the <dfn>book</dfn>, but it seems to be written it <dfn>stupid language that rewrites itself as it is read</dfn>. Thus, only <dfn>one pony</dfn> can read it at a time. Since it is a <dfn>book of cpells</dfn> [of sorts], you let <dfn>sweetie belle</dfn> do the <dfn>reading</dfn>. It's not like you can <dfn>learn them</dfn>.</p>

<p><dfn>sweetie belle</dfn> says she found something that might work. Will you try it? (Y/N)</p>


<p class="prompt">ask about what she discovered first.</p>

<p><dfn>sweetie belle</dfn> says that it is a <dfn>genocide cpell</dfn>, of the <dfn>kind</dfn> found in most <dfn>roguelike games</dfn>. She thinks she will cast it on the <dfn>kind</dfn> of <dfn>filth</dfn>, eliminating <dfn>all filth</dfn> from the <dfn>universe</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt question">Can I <dfn>use points</dfn> to ensure the <dfn>saftey</dfn> of this <dfn>cpell</dfn>?</p>
<p>What kind of points? </p>

<p class="prompt comment">Points like the ones I got for getting clean.</p>
<p>Oh, no, those are used after the game is complete. They're for <dfn>dlc</dfn> and alternate endings and such.</p>

<p class="prompt comment">Oh.</p>
<p>It's Seguellogysms that require special ponts that you get from doing cool things. You've earned a few.</p>

<p class="prompt">asks sweetie belle how safe the cpell would be, as it would be unfortunate if sweetie belle accidentally targets pegasi.</p>
<p>She doesn't know. She is only in junior high, like you; she hasn't even branched off to <dfn>MAJIKK cinderjarden</dfn> yet.</p>

<p class="prompt">check on twilight and see if she will talk to you</p>
<p><dfn>twilight sparkle pony</dfn> says <dfn>hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii</dfn>iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii.</p>

<p class="prompt">Ask her if she feels good enought to cast a cpell</p>
<p><dfn>twilight sparkly pony</dfn> feeeeeeeeeells <dfn>sooo</dfn> gooood you wouldn't <dfn>even believe</dfn>.</p>

<p><dfn>sure</dfn> she'll acst a shpeel. What cpal?</p>


<p class="prompt comment">takes <dfn>smuchk biat</p>
<p class="prompt">be twilight</p>
<p><dfn>this is amazing you guys whoa</p>
<p>You are now Twilight. Or rather, a few hours ago you would have been Twilight. But then, well, a lot of things have happened since then&hellip;</p>
<p>now you are <dfn>the universe</dfn>.</p>
<p>You can't really explain it, you just&hellip; just &hellip;man.</p>
<p>Just, yeah.</p>

<p>Anyway, you win.</p>

<p class="prompt comment">Do I get infinite points for being the <dfn>universe</dfn>?</p>
<p><dfn>no</dfn>. Being the universe <dfn>sucks oh god</dfn> I want <dfn>out</dfn> it's <dfn>too big fuck</dfn> I haaannnngggnnnnaaahh. help</p>

<p class="prompt">Lu: Ask Twilight if she's sure she's feeling alright.</p>
<p><dfn>twilight sparkle pony</dfn> is curled into a <dfn>ball</dfn> on the <dfn>floor</dfn>. She looks like she needs a <dfn>hug</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">give twilight A hug</p>
<p>Twilight <dfn>feels better</dfn>. However, Twilight is now <dfn>filthy</dfn> as well.</p>

<p class="prompt">ask twilight to cast the cpell to get rid of all of the filth.</p>

<p>Twilight <dfn>nods</dfn>, as she currently sees the <dfn>beautiful logic</dfn> in this proposal. Without <dfn>filth</dfn>, the world will no longer have <dfn>scary fractal complexity</dfn> that makes her brain <dfn>shatter into sharp pieces</dfn>. She casts the <dfn>cpell</dfn>.</p>

<p>Suddenly, nopony's body contains <dfn>mitochondria</dfn>!</p>

<p class="prompt comment">I hate you :P (jk of course)</p>

<p> All viruses, bacteria, and other forms of lower life have been eradicated. As have all rocks below a certain size, and the skeletons of many dead insects. Beaches no longer exist. The sea floor is hard rock.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> What did you think filth was?</p>

<p class="prompt">Dance</p>

<p>You attempt to <dfn>dance</dfn>, but within moments all cells within your body experience <dfn>apoptosis</dfn> from a lack of <dfn>energy</dfn>. You fall over in the most amazing display of <dfn>sudden spontaneous death</dfn> ever witnessed. By nobody, of course; they're all <dfn>dead</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">undo</p>

<p><dfn>filth</dfn> exists once more. Your living bodies <dfn>revel</dfn> in it.</p>

<p>Twilight experiences this whole divergent timeline within her <dfn>mind's eye</dfn>, and sheds a <dfn>single tear</dfn> in <dfn>amazement</dfn>.</p>

<p>Tilight: <dfn>devote life</dfn> to <dfn>redefining filth</dfn> so that you can one day <dfn>cast</dfn> the <dfn>cpell</dfn> in a less <dfn>destructive</dfn> and <dfn>murderous manner</p>

<p><dfn>cpells</dfn> do not work on the <dfn>taxonomies defined by mortal man</dfn>. <dfn>cpells</dfn> operate on the <dfn>taxonomies decided on by the royal canterlot bureau of inadequately-useful alchemical interactions</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt question">How about a <dfn>mortal pony</dfn>? Those have <dfn>got</dfn> to be <dfn>better</dfn> and more <dfn>influential</p>
<p>Those are even <dfn>less influential</dfn>, existing as they do within a <dfn>clunky simulation</dfn>. <dfn>twilight sparkle pony</dfn> frequently <dfn>goes on trips</dfn> to <dfn>forget</dfn> about how someone could <dfn>turn off her universe</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">screw it and just get twilight to eliminate the smell and the visible grossness emanating from  their bodies.</p>

<p>Twilight casts another <dfn>cpell</dfn>, this one much more <dfn>mundane</dfn>. Both you and <dfn>sweetie belle</dfn> (and I guess <dfn>twilight</dfn> herself) are now <dfn>visibly clean</dfn>. However&hellip;</p>

<p>&hellip;you have not earned 500 points, as you aren't <dfn>actually</dfn> clean.</p>

<p class="prompt comment"><dfn>don't do it</p>
<p>(No, this is probably the good solution. Though you'll have to deal with its consequences.)</p>
<p>(good XD)</p>

<p class="prompt comment">I can live with them being dirty with <dfn>mitochondria</dfn> XD (is too tired to come up with full solution)</p>
<p>Here, let's have a demonstration:</p>

<p><dfn>sweetie belle</dfn> touches a <dfn>chair</dfn>. The <dfn>chair</dfn> is now covered in <dfn>mutagenic filth</dfn>, despite her <dfn>apparent cleanliness</dfn>.</p>

<p>Oh dear.</p>

<p class="prompt question">Is the chair apparently clean?</p>
<p>No. The chair is visibly filthy. You and <dfn>sweetie belle</dfn> are now "carriers" of a <dfn>filth virus</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Scootaloo and sweetie belle take a nap, sleeping on their problem.</p>
<p>They <dfn>do</dfn>. It feels <dfn>quite nice</dfn>. They turn out to be able to <dfn>touch each other</dfn> without getting <dfn>visibly filthy</dfn> any longer, so they do that. A <dfn>lot</dfn>. In a <dfn>tired</dfn>, <dfn>cuddly manner</dfn>.</p>

<p>+3 more <dfn>s-class relationship points</dfn>. (Lu actually already has a lot of those from previous adventures. Ruby gave her +600 or so. I think Coronet gave her at least +70.)</p>


<p class="prompt">Don hazmat suit that everypony seems to just have lying around</p>
<p>This is a <dfn>great idea</dfn> and a <dfn>good temporary solution</dfn>, as it <dfn>would seem</dfn>. You try to <dfn>put on</dfn> the <dfn>suit</dfn>. However, as soon as you <dfn>touch</dfn> the <dfn>helmet</dfn>, <dfn>filth</dfn> spreads from the inside and <dfn>races around</dfn> to <dfn>cover</dfn> the <dfn>faceplace</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt question">But does the suit communicate the virus to other objects?</p>
<p>Yes. The <dfn>filth</dfn> is now <dfn>extremely virile</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Twilight: Use magical genetic engineering to make the invisibility and smellessness of the virus hereditary</p>
<p>The <dfn>virus</dfn> becomes known as <dfn>aids</dfn>, and goes on to kill <dfn>trillions of ponies</dfn>. <dfn>utopia</dfn> has been <dfn>destroyed</dfn>. Probably <dfn>undo</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">undo</p>
<p>'kay. Figured as such. (An <dfn>invisible filth virus</dfn> is a metaphor for an <dfn>std</dfn>, as of <dfn>right now</dfn>.)</p>

<p>(I blame delirium caused by lack of sleep. XD In fact, I blame most of this on that. XD)</p>
<p>XD</p>

<p class="prompt">Realize that you've given a chair a sexually transmitted disease</p>
<p><dfn>toilet seats</dfn> have held this position in a <dfn>long tradition</dfn>. Other <dfn>chairs</dfn> are just <dfn>catching up</dfn> over <dfn>time</dfn> by doing all their <dfn>filthing</dfn> at once.</p>

<p class="prompt question">Do ponies have a cure for aids? Magical pony laaand</p>
<p>Like I said way at the beginning of this thing&hellip; pony <dfn>std</dfn>s have been eradicated, but are not actively stopped from re-emerging</p>

<p class="prompt">Narrator: Make all of this canon through semantic shenanigans and time tomfoolery</p>
<p>The <dfn>narrator</dfn> makes all of this <dfn>canon</dfn> by shooting it out of a <dfn>cannon</dfn> with the N removed. It seems to <dfn>work</dfn>, as far as he can see, but he <dfn>fails to realize</dfn> that he exists only as a <dfn>character in</dfn> A <dfn>writestream</dfn>, and has <dfn>no effect on any continuities</dfn>, <dfn>even those of tumblr</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Tsutsu: Make all of this canon through slightly fewer semantic shenanigans but with slightly more author powers</p>
<p>I'm <dfn>not sure how to make this canon</dfn> without making the <dfn>wild rarity</dfn> an <dfn>extremely silly character</dfn> that would have to eventually be <dfn>retconned from the story</dfn>.</p>
<p class="prompt comment">Divergence 2.5, retconned by Luna entirely for silliness? lol</p>

<p>You suddenly find the fact that your first name is <dfn>schema</dfn> mildly amusing for some unknown reason. (Filthmonster gambit schema eeee~)</p>

<p>You are standing in a <dfn>library</dfn>. There is a <dfn>very high twilight sparkle</dfn> staring at you, while her <dfn>pathetic assistant</dfn> scurries about. <dfn>sweetie belle</dfn> is beside you, wondering what you shall <dfn>get up to on this fine day</dfn>. Suddenly, you are standing in deer urine.</p>

<p class="prompt">Pet sweetie belle's mane I really like her mane.</p>
<p>You reach over, and, with gentleness and care befitting the <dfn>holiest of saints</dfn>, you touch your <dfn>hoof</dfn> to <dfn>sweetie belle'</dfn>s <dfn>mane</dfn>. Immediately, like some sort of <dfn>sick parody of king midas</dfn>, you cause <dfn>sweetie belle</dfn> to get covered in <dfn>filth</dfn>.</p>

<p>She <dfn>does not notice</dfn>, because her <dfn>imagination</dfn> is at <dfn>maximum</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Say "eeeeyuck! you've been slobbered!"</p>
<p>You <dfn>say</dfn> this. As always, the <dfn>people reading this text</dfn> only hear <dfn>horse noises</dfn>. <dfn>sweetie belle</dfn> looks down and <dfn>groans</dfn> in realization that your <dfn>filth</dfn> problems have not been <dfn>solved</dfn>. However, unlike before, she immediately <dfn>goes and showers</dfn> to clean herself, because now that will not <dfn>kill you</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">masturbate thinking of her in the shower</p>
<p>You <dfn>masturbate</dfn> right in front of <dfn>twilight sparkle pony</dfn>. She <dfn>giggles slightly</dfn> and goes to get a <dfn>frozen pizza</dfn> to <dfn>nuke</dfn> with her <dfn>pyroMAJIKKX</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Learn Latin to understand what the hell a pyroMAJIKKX is.</p>
<p>You <dfn>already know latin</dfn>. You still have <dfn>no idea</dfn> what <dfn>pyroMAJIKKX</dfn> is, even though it could be deduced easily by the <dfn>readers of this text</dfn> by splitting it into its constituent roots, because this is one of <dfn>those</dfn> games, where you need to <dfn>find something to trip</dfn> A <dfn>flag</dfn> showing you <dfn>know of its existence</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Do it. Faggot.</p>
<p>You re-enact the storyline of Infinity's Tale, or "<dfn>it</dfn>" for short. It takes five weeks. Luckily, nothing happens to change the <dfn>world state</dfn> during this performance. You find that</p>

<p class="prompt">the next day, everyone fucking dies.</p>
<p>You try to <dfn>will this into happening</dfn>, but sadly your powers of <dfn>tomfoolery</dfn> do not reach to that level. Perhaps you could ask Miss Pinkamina for assistance?</p>
<p>Well, damn.</p>
<p class="prompt">Punch a hole in the wall.</p>
<p>You proceed to <dfn>lay</dfn> A <dfn>beat down</dfn> on the innocent <dfn>wall</dfn>s of the <dfn>library</dfn>. <dfn>Spike</dfn> sheds a <dfn>single tear</dfn>, in the way that only a character whose <dfn>patheticness is maximum</dfn> can do.</p>

<p class="prompt">Wash an old person</p>
<p>You do not see <dfn>an old person</dfn> here.</p>

<p class="prompt">Raid the fridge!</p>
<p>You attempt to <dfn>raid the fridge</dfn>, but <dfn>twilight sparkle pony</dfn> is already <dfn>raiding</dfn> the <dfn>fridge</dfn> in a fit of <dfn>munchies</dfn>. You will have to <dfn>wait your turn</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Check your gayventory</p>
<p>You take a gander at the <dfn>inventorial bullshittery mechanism</dfn>, which will doubtlessly cause you <dfn>all sorts of trouble</dfn> if you would <dfn>ever manage to pick up more than one thing at</dfn> A <dfn>time</dfn>. Right now you have <dfn>nothing</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Do a trick on your scooter and don't act like a chicken</p>
<p>(Taking <dfn>scooter</dfn> from outside) You <dfn>get massive air</dfn>, earning <dfn>style points</dfn>, which are <dfn>pretty damn useless</dfn>.</p>
<p>You <dfn>try</dfn> to not act like a chicken, but <dfn>fail</dfn>. You <dfn>squawk</dfn> in <dfn>sweetie belle'</dfn>s <dfn>ear</dfn> as she <dfn>returns</dfn> from her shower. It is a good thing that she has her <dfn>own problems</dfn>, or she wouldn't be <dfn>your friend</dfn> for long.</p>

<p class="prompt">Jailbreak the non-obsolete computing device, or perhaps consider doing so at a better time later.</p>
<p>Do you want to go all the way back home to pick up the <dfn>non-obsolete computing device</dfn>? (Y/N)</p>
<p>No, but pontification for the future is possible.</p>
<p>You <dfn>consider jailbreaking</dfn> the n<dfn>ocd</dfn>. It, sadly, is running the <dfn>newest revision</dfn> of the <dfn>horriblly locked-down operating system</dfn> it came with, for which there is not yet a <dfn>published jailbreak</dfn>. Luckily, you don't see much reason to do this anyway, as <dfn>you have plenty of spare bits</dfn> from all of Miss Pinkamina's inventional <dfn>patent royalties</dfn>, and so can <dfn>afford to buy shit</dfn> on the n<dfn>ocd'</dfn>s <dfn>stupid store</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">look at twilight sparkle pony and see if she notices sweetie belle is covered in filth</p>
<p>You <dfn>look</dfn> at <dfn>twilight sparkle pony</dfn>. She does not even notice <dfn>that she is standing on the counter</dfn>, let alone that <dfn>sweetie belle</dfn> is <dfn>filthy</dfn> (which she <dfn>no longer is</dfn>, having had a <dfn>shower</dfn>.)</p>

<p class="prompt">Use your computer to log onto tumblr and check your many, many messages</p>
<p>(Getting computer from <dfn>house</dfn>.) You <dfn>check your messages</dfn>. You have <dfn>so much spam</dfn>. It's kind of ridiculous how many people get <dfn>up in your business</dfn> about <dfn>posting</dfn> whenever you feel lazy for even a single <dfn>day</dfn>. You wish they would just <dfn>write about the events of your life that only you know about</dfn> themselves. Which is a quite intricate and useless <dfn>wish</dfn>, of <dfn>precisely the kind</dfn> that could go <dfn>so wrong</dfn> in the hands of a <dfn>djinn-master of tomfoolery</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">relay wish to twilight sparkle pony</p>
<p>You <dfn>inform twilight</dfn> of your <dfn>intense desire</dfn> for <dfn>everyone everywhere</dfn> to know about <dfn>all the events of your life</dfn> without you having to <dfn>lift</dfn> A <dfn>hooftip</dfn>. She <dfn>thinks</dfn> for a moment, then, <dfn>sniggering like</dfn> A <dfn>madfilly</dfn>, wiggles her hooves in the air.</p>

<p>A <dfn>room</dfn> is <dfn>created</dfn> on the <dfn>Ponynet</dfn> where <dfn>people</dfn> can <dfn>watch and direct</dfn> your <dfn>actions</dfn>. It is all very <dfn>temporally self-fulfilling</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Stop having sex with sex dolls.</p>
<p>(It's okay, everyone does it. That's what makes it so.. so&hellip; nynaaaa~)</p>

<p class="prompt">Acquire swag-ass real estate and pimping hat.</p>
<p>You <dfn>acquire</dfn> both of <dfn>these things</dfn>. It <dfn>occurs</dfn> to you that <dfn>equestria is</dfn> A <dfn>centrally-planned</dfn>, <dfn>somewhat communist</dfn> state where <dfn>property does not exist</dfn>, at least in the sense of <dfn>land-ownership</dfn>, so really you just now have a <dfn>pimping hat</dfn>.</p>

<p>+3 <dfn>style points</dfn>. (Still useless)</p>
<p><dfn>patheticness points</dfn> are now at 0.</p>

<p class="prompt">Pontificate where these strange urges and non sequiturs in your mind that don't seem to be relevant to your situation are coming from.</p>
<p>You <dfn>think</dfn> it may have had something to do with the <dfn>wish</dfn> you made just <dfn>moments ago</dfn>. In a very <dfn>paradoxical</dfn> way.</p>

<p class="prompt">Consider resisting the urges and performing a thematically consistent and diegetically continuous narrative eligible for the pulitzer prize of fiction, or at least the caldecott medal (for the children).</p>
<p>You <dfn>consider</dfn> this for a moment, but then <dfn>realize</dfn> that that would entail some <dfn>mysterious author</dfn> getting <dfn>off his ass</dfn> and <dfn>writing the rest of the wake arc</dfn>. You have a feeling that <dfn>he really would rather see how many different ways he can come up with to procrastinate from this</dfn>. <dfn>using capital letters</dfn>.</p>
<p class="prompt comment"><dfn>like</dfn> A <dfn>bauss</p>
<p>Gaussian cannons are cool. poopybutts ಠ_ಠ</p>

<p class="prompt">Have a tag team match with you and sweetie belle verses twilight sparkle pony and Spike for control of the library</p>
<p>You cannot convince <dfn>sweetie belle</dfn> or <dfn>twilight sparkle pony</dfn> to join you in your <dfn>match</dfn>. So, you just decide to <dfn>beat up Spike</dfn>.</p>
<p class="prompt comment">this decision will suffice</p>
<p><dfn>Spike</dfn>, whose <dfn>patheticness is always maximum</dfn>, becomes <dfn>Spike</dfn>, whose <dfn>death was quite anticlimactic</dfn>.</p>

<p>You earn <dfn>no</dfn> experience, because <dfn>Spike</dfn> has the <dfn>challenge rating</dfn> of a <dfn>moldy banana</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Ask sweetie for a clopjob/hoofing</p>

<p>              </p>

<p>              </p>
<p>              </p>
<p><dfn>horse noises</dfn> escape your <dfn>gumflaps</dfn>. <dfn>sweetie belle</dfn> nods, then pauses for just a moment. Then longer than a moment. It seems</p>

<p>              </p>

<p>               <dfn>sweetie belle</dfn> is now <dfn>imagining</dfn> something.</p>

<p>              </p>

<p class="prompt">Ask a Clopjob for a sweetie.</p>
<p>You do not see any <dfn>clopjobs</dfn> to ask.</p>

<p class="prompt">Have some of whatever twilight sparkle pony is having.</p>
<p>You ask <dfn>twilight sparkle pony</dfn> for some of her <dfn>best shit</dfn>. She <dfn>hooks you up</dfn>. Your <dfn>perceptual smear</dfn> is now at 0.3.</p>

<p>No.</p>
<p>You <dfn>smack</dfn> all the <dfn>bitches</dfn> asking for pornography right in their fat, greasy, virgin <dfn>faces</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">look for a book about how to defend yourself and place it on Spike's body</p>
<p>You <dfn>look</dfn>. You see, amongst the <dfn>massive shelf of sleep-lulling non-fiction titles</dfn>, a <dfn>fifty-pound spider</dfn> with the title "How to <dfn>defend</dfn>." You <dfn>pull the spider</dfn> off the <dfn>shelf</dfn> and put it on <dfn>Spike'</dfn>s <dfn>carcass</dfn>, which is promptly <dfn>devoured</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt question">Dearest Manager, do you already have an <dfn>ending</dfn> in mind for this game, or are you <dfn>really playing it by ear</dfn>?</p>
<p>(I have something interesting in mind, and quite a few game systems left to introduce, if anyone would <dfn>go questing in</dfn> A <dfn>manner befitting</dfn> A <dfn>game-like protagonist</dfn>.)</p>

<p>              </p>

<p class="prompt">Do the Mario. Swing your arms from side to side.</p>
<p>Done.</p>
<p>+ 5 <dfn>style points</dfn>.</p>
<p>But also,</p>
<p>+ 2 <dfn>patheticness</dfn>.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the <dfn>fifty-foot tall wild rarity</dfn> manages to <dfn>break open the side of the library</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Attempt to filthy her mane</p>
<p>You <dfn>touch</dfn> the <dfn>rarity</dfn>. She becomes <dfn>filthier than the content of your own fantasies</dfn>, which are admittedly <dfn>all-the-way filthy</dfn>. She <dfn>shrieks</dfn> and <dfn>falls to the ground</dfn>, seemingly trying to <dfn>stop drop and roll</dfn> the <dfn>filth</dfn> away like some sort of <dfn>flame of awfulness</dfn>. It does not seem to be <dfn>working</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Is the library being destroyed?</p>
<p>The <dfn>library'</dfn>s <dfn>structural soundness</dfn> is at an <dfn>all-time low</dfn>, due to both <dfn>the wild rarity'</dfn>s attack and your own. However, nothing is actively <dfn>destroy</dfn>ing it at the moment. It will probably fall apart quite quickly on its own, though, due to A <dfn>startling lack of negentropy</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Hope that she made lotsa dinner.</p>
<p>You <dfn>hope</dfn>. Your <dfn>hope</dfn> is somewhat fulfilled when you see just how many <dfn>frozen pizza</dfn>s <dfn>twilight sparkle pony</dfn> has managed to stuff into her poor <dfn>pyrobox</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">come on its time to go into twilight sparkle pony's vagina</p>
<p>(Entered.)</p>
<p>You are now in <dfn>twilight sparkle pony'</dfn>s <dfn>vagina</dfn>. It is <dfn>dark</dfn> and <dfn>wet</dfn>. You are likely to be eaten by a <dfn>crab</dfn>.</p>
<p>(Hey, Twat. What's wet and loose?) Your poo-see.</p>
<p class="prompt">Determine if your body size has been decreased or if only part of your body is in the new location.</p>
<p>(You <dfn>examine self</dfn> to determine this.)</p>
<p>You seem to be <dfn>fully engulfed</dfn> in a room that is <dfn>much larger</dfn> than your entire frame, slightly diminuitive though that may be. In fact, you are not sure <dfn>how you got here</dfn>, or whether this place actually has anything to do with <dfn>an organ located in</dfn> A <dfn>pony</dfn> at all. It's probably just an <dfn>location modelling convenience</dfn> of some sort.</p>

<p class="prompt">hey listen, listen. the cat's a-pissin.</p>
<p class="prompt">listen for a heartbeat</p>
<p>You <dfn>hear</dfn> a <dfn>heartbeat</dfn>, coming from the <dfn>distance</dfn> of the <dfn>tunnel of love</dfn>. It reminds you of <dfn>that recolored cavern at the end of chrono trigger</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Aquire twilight sparkle pony's ovaries</p>
<p>You <dfn>approach</dfn> the <dfn>heartbeat</dfn>, and find yourself at a <dfn>diverging path</dfn>. You take the <dfn>left path</dfn> arbitrarily, and wind up inside a <dfn>three-dimensional forest of slippery bubbles</dfn>. You are not sure how to <dfn>take</dfn> the location you are currently <dfn>swimming around in</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt question">Does this count as <dfn>questing</dfn>?</p>
<p>Inasmuch as this is a <dfn>dungeon</dfn>, yes.</p>

<p class="prompt">Craft ovaries into nunchyaku</p>
<p>Your <dfn>tomfoolery</dfn> level is <dfn>way too low</dfn> for that.</p>

<p class="prompt">consume one bubble.</p>
<p>You take a <dfn>bubble</dfn> carefully between your <dfn>sodden hooves</dfn>, ignoring the immediate transfer of <dfn>filth</dfn>. You put it to your <dfn>lips</dfn> and take a <dfn>nibble</dfn>.</p>

<p>It tastes like <dfn>babies</dfn>. A taste you are <dfn>intimately familiar with</dfn>.</p>
<p>(:ohgod:)</p>

<p class="prompt">Attempt to craft anything. Feel useless if you do not succeed.</p>
<p>You <dfn>smush</dfn> two <dfn>bubbles</dfn> together. You form a <dfn>bubble barbell</dfn>. You wonder if the <dfn>crafting system</dfn> works almost exactly like <dfn>minecraft's</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Pee on a homeless pony.</p>
<p>You see no <dfn>pony</dfn> here, besides yourself. </p>
<p class="prompt">Become homeless so you can pee on yourself.</p>
<p>(Leaving <dfn>twilight sparkle pony'</dfn>s <dfn>vagina</dfn>, going to your <dfn>home</dfn>, and <dfn>thunderwool</dfn>ing it to <dfn>smithereen</dfn>s) You are now <dfn>homeless</dfn>.</p>
<p class="prompt comment"><dfn>not the swag ass land</dfn>!!!!!!!</p>
<p>(I remind you that you can always <dfn>undo</dfn>, because you have <dfn>never attempted this before</dfn> and it is the <dfn>first time it is relevant</dfn>.)</p>

<p class="prompt">undo becoming homeless</p>
<p>You <dfn>underwool</dfn> the <dfn>house</dfn>, <dfn>MAJIKKally</dfn> bringing it <dfn>back together</dfn> from <dfn>burnt</dfn> and <dfn>splintered embers</dfn>. You <dfn>marvel</dfn> at the fact that in neither description was Miss Pinkamina ever <dfn>mentioned</dfn>. You <dfn>wonder</dfn> where she <dfn>went</dfn>.</p>

<p>Also, you are now back inside an <dfn>ovary</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">That's an explicit instruction from the developer, which is bad game design. undo anyway. (So, this is undoing what is undone.) [Only in old if engines!]</p>
<p>You <dfn>undo</dfn> the <dfn>undo stack'</dfn>s <dfn>stacking</dfn>, causing it to become an <dfn>undo acyclic directed graph</dfn>. You have <dfn>no idea</dfn> what the <dfn>implications of this will be</dfn>. It is likely something the <dfn>developers never intended to happen</dfn>. (Nice going. We're all dead.)</p>

<p class="prompt">Ignore below comment.</p>

<p class="prompt">undo previous night</p>
<p>You <dfn>consider undo</dfn>ing <dfn>last night</dfn>, but your recollection of it is <dfn>too vague</dfn> to alter.</p>
<p class="prompt comment">Not enough memory; oh look, I made a pun.</p>
<p>(No, <dfn>vagueness</dfn> means something totally different in <dfn>bedstuck</dfn>. Lu means that it was <dfn>too much dirty messy wet slippery fun</dfn>.)</p>
<p class="prompt comment">I would like to comment that "<dfn>vaguegina</dfn>" was a wonderful creation.</p>
<p>(Thank you~)</p>

<p class="prompt question"><dfn>list MAJIKKX</p>
<p>You have communed with the spirit of <dfn>thunderwool</dfn>, giving you the power of <dfn>static MAJIKKtricity</dfn>.</p>
<p>You are dimly aware of the spirit of <dfn>tomfoolery</dfn>, probably due to you, <dfn>Loki</dfn>, <dfn>the player</dfn>, being the <dfn>god</dfn> of it.</p>

<p class="prompt">Equip barbells. Venture deeper into the caverns.</p>
<p>You <dfn>equip</dfn> the <dfn>barbells</dfn>. Your <dfn>frustgruntlement gague</dfn> has been <dfn>halved</dfn>. You can now achieve <dfn>maximum frustgruntlement</dfn> after only <dfn>two annoyance events</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">examine bubbles.</p>
<p>You do.</p>

<p class="prompt">unexamine bubbles.</p>
<p>You do, causing all text above after "You do" to be hidden.</p>

<p class="prompt">It should be dark. ponder light source.</p>
<p>You <dfn>notice</dfn> that you are <dfn>glowing slightly</dfn>, possibly due to the <dfn>MAJIKKal effects</dfn> hiding your <dfn>filth</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">It should be difficult to breathe. ponder oxygen source.</p>
<p>You have long-ago mastered the feat of <dfn>run-on sentences</dfn>, as taught by the master <dfn>applebloom pony</dfn>. You have little need for <dfn>oxygen</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">tap and push the room's walls and listen.</p>
<p>You <dfn>massage</dfn> the <dfn>walls</dfn> in a <dfn>soft and rhythmic manner</dfn>. You feel a <dfn>massive clench</dfn>, and your <dfn>body is crushed slightly by the walls</dfn>.</p>

<p>You <dfn>hear</dfn> a <dfn>heartbeat</dfn>. And a <dfn>moan</dfn>. And a <dfn>stifled snort</dfn>.</p>

<p>&hellip;yeah, this is still <dfn>twilight sparkle pony</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">commune with the Loki, the spirit of tomfoolery</p>
<p>You are not <dfn>aware</dfn> of the <dfn>existence</dfn> of <dfn>Loki</dfn>, other than as an <dfn>annoying presence</dfn> in your <dfn>mind</dfn>. Perhaps that <dfn>idiot Loki</dfn> should try something <dfn>himself</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Cough on Twilight to give her an sti</p>
<p>You <dfn>touch</dfn> the <dfn>walls</dfn>, wondering why doing this did not spread your <dfn>filth</dfn> earlier. You watch as an <dfn>ugly smear</dfn> appears on the <dfn>ovarian boundary</dfn>, but then is quickly <dfn>erased</dfn> by some unknown <dfn>force</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">For i in bubbles:</p>
<p>    >Burst <dfn>bubble</p>
<p>You render <dfn>twilight sparkle pony</dfn> into a <dfn>barren shell of marehood</dfn>. She does not seem to mind.</p>

<p class="prompt">swim to follow the heartbeat-like sound.</p>
<p>You <dfn>swim</dfn> toward the <dfn>sound</dfn>, but promptly <dfn>knock your head</dfn> against the <dfn>wall</dfn>. You <dfn>fail</dfn> to follow it, because you are <dfn>inside an organ</dfn>, <dfn>not in the bloodstream</dfn>, <dfn>you snivveling dweeb</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">attempt to slip between two capillary cells.</p>
<p>You discover that you are <dfn>not that size</dfn>. It turns out that <dfn>egg cells</dfn> are much, much <dfn>larger</dfn> than every other kind of cell.trufax</p>

<p class="prompt">drop barbell</p>
<p>You <dfn>unequip</dfn> and <dfn>drop</dfn> the <dfn>barbell</dfn>. It <dfn>floats</dfn> uselessly in the <dfn>ovarian void</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">attempt to slip between two capillary cells.</p>
<p>You <dfn>reuse the solution to the emerald puzzle that first appeared in advent</dfn>. Your <dfn>lack of inventorial bullshittery</dfn> allows you to somehow <dfn>enter the crevice much smaller than your own body</dfn>. You are now in <dfn>twilight sparkle pony'</dfn>s <dfn>blood</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt comment">Leukocytes can slip through very easily. And isn't Scootaloo really flexible, as you say?</p>
<p>(Yes, she just didn't <dfn>try hard enough</dfn> before. Remember, <dfn>semantic simulations</dfn> are all about <dfn>perception</dfn>.)</p>

<p class="prompt">discover a benign tumor.</p>
<p>You <dfn>find</dfn> A <dfn>big ball of cells</dfn> attached to the outside of <dfn>twilight sparkle pony'</dfn>s <dfn>lung</dfn>. It looks a bit like a <dfn>snowmare</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">ask tumor a question.</p>
<p>You make <dfn>horse noises</dfn> at the <dfn>tumor</dfn>. It replies with <dfn>cell noises</dfn>. The <dfn>audience</dfn> is <dfn>invigorated</dfn> by this display of <dfn>interspecies bonding</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Loki: Create path clones of Scootaloo, so that she can fulfill all command paths at the same time</p>
<p>Loki, although being the <dfn>god of tomfoolery</dfn>, cannot create a <dfn>protagonist</dfn> from <dfn>thin air</dfn>. You could ask <dfn>the goddess of branches</dfn> to make <dfn>Scootaloo pony</dfn> no <dfn>longer the protagonist</dfn> (as you have done several times in this playthrough) so that you could <dfn>duplicate her</dfn>, but then she would be a <dfn>boring npc</dfn> and you would not <dfn>win</dfn> when you managed to execute this <dfn>plan</dfn>.</p>

<p>It was a <dfn>smashing good idea</dfn>, though. I am beginning to <dfn>curry favor</dfn> to you, <dfn>Loki</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">tumor fills you with fear, you leave vagina to tend to the giant rarity situation [Though she's not quite&hellip;in that particular place anymore.]</p>
<p>You <dfn>explode out of twilight'</dfn>s <dfn>mouth like an alien</dfn>. Somehow this <dfn>does not cause harm to either of you</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">defend yourself from leukocytes, complement and antibodies (?).</p>
<p>You see none of these things here. You also are still unaware of the meaning of <dfn>defend</dfn>, as you have not read the <dfn>fifty-pound spider</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">interact with neuroganglia or spinal cord.</p>
<p>You <dfn>reach into twilight's head</dfn> with as careful a display of <dfn>thunderwool</dfn>ing the world has ever seen. You <dfn>poke various things</dfn> without being sure as to your exact goal. Twilight has a <dfn>MAJIKKal seizure</dfn>. Far in the distance, a <dfn>whale</dfn> and a <dfn>flower pot rejoice</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">decide whether to approach heart or brain.</p>
<p>You <dfn>realize</dfn> that the <dfn>fifty-foot rarity'</dfn>s <dfn>heart</dfn> is probably the right size to be <dfn>approached</dfn>. However, you wonder what getting a heart <dfn>filthy</dfn> would do. Probably cause <dfn>arterial plaque</dfn> leading to a <dfn>murmur</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Attempt to catch the giant rarity&hellip; in a net or something</p>
<p>You have no net. You, however, do have <dfn>something</dfn>. You catch the <dfn>fifty-foot wild rarity</dfn> in a <dfn>sweetie belle</dfn>.</p>

<p><dfn>sweetie belle</dfn> shifts in discomfort.</p>

<p class="prompt">Attempt to pee on the wild rarity to extinguish that imaginary fire she is apparently trying to put out by rolling around and wailing</p>
<p>Given her present <dfn>vague</dfn> location, <dfn>sweetie belle giggles</dfn> as you <dfn>do this</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Dodge to the left</p>
<p>You try to <dfn>dodge</dfn>, but then notice that <dfn>dodging</dfn> seems a bit too close to <dfn>defending</dfn> for you to know how to do it.</p>

<p class="prompt">Loki: Use combat specibus:wordplay on rarity's fifty feet</p>
<p>The <dfn>wild rarity explodes</dfn> in a <dfn>shower</dfn> of <dfn>literal interpretation</dfn>. <dfn>sweetie belle</dfn> will be coughing up <dfn>feet</dfn> for <dfn>weeks</dfn>. Which is <dfn>strange</dfn>, given that <dfn>rarity</dfn> doesn't even have <dfn>feet</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Throw the hot pies into Rarity's face.</p>
<p>You open the <dfn>pyrobox</dfn>, releasing the <dfn>charred remains</dfn> of <dfn>several dozen pizzas</dfn>. You pick up the <dfn>conflagration</dfn> and <dfn>huck it</dfn> at <dfn>rarity'</dfn>s <dfn>remains</dfn>.</p>

<p><dfn>twilight sparkle pony</dfn> wanders over and <dfn>consumes the entire sticky mess</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Look up fan-guides on bedstuck on GameFAQs.com to determine what the developers think you're supposed to do next and commit suicide for having ever thought of doing so.</p>
<p>You <dfn>look for</dfn> A <dfn>guide to playing bedstuck</dfn>. Sadly, <dfn>this universe does not seem to be cleverly-reentrant enough</dfn> for <dfn>bedstuck</dfn> to be a game that <dfn>exists within your own sim-level</dfn>.</p>
<p>You suggest that <dfn>Loki</dfn> do the same thing, even though <dfn>you do not know who that is</dfn>.</p>

<p>Also, you <dfn>commit suicide</dfn> in the most <dfn>extravagant and failure-prone method you can imagine</dfn>. The <dfn>duck</dfn> and the <dfn>seven meters of fishing tackle</dfn> summoned up to <dfn>aide</dfn> your attempt <dfn>applaud your creativity</dfn>.</p>

<p>Of course, it <dfn>fails</dfn>.</p>

<p>You <dfn>undo</dfn> the <dfn>suicide</dfn> of <dfn>some guy you have never met</dfn>.</p>

<p>You are standing in a half-destroyed, somewhat burnt-down <dfn>library</dfn>. There are <dfn>feet</dfn> everywhere. The floor is covered in <dfn>burnt cheese</dfn>. <dfn>sweetie belle</dfn> is <dfn>rubbing her vague parts</dfn> and wishing they didn't <dfn>sting</dfn> so much.</p>

<p class="prompt">Get input from sweetie belle on what to do next. This scene has gotten stale for your cool tendancies.</p>
<p>You think that this is a <dfn>good idea</dfn>. Your <dfn>horse noises</dfn> trigger <dfn>sweetie belle</dfn> to <dfn>motion you out the door</dfn>. Do you follow her? (Y/N)</p>

<p class="prompt">offer to help apple bloom around the farm</p>
<p><dfn>applebloom pony</dfn> says that she has <dfn>bucked enough things</dfn> for a while. She wants to go do <dfn>something else</dfn>, possibly involving the <dfn>two of you</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Try to equip and then use any applebloom you encounter</p>
<p>You <dfn>use applebloom</dfn>. She <dfn>likes being used</dfn>.</p>
<p>+6 <dfn>s-class relationship points</dfn>.</p>

<p>Also, <dfn>applebloom</dfn> is now <dfn>filthy</dfn>, because, as you should recall, <dfn>filth</dfn> is A <dfn>blatant metaphor for the spread of sexually-transmitted infection</dfn>.</p>

<p><dfn>or not</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Attempt to commune with your chicken breathren at the farm</p>
<p>The <dfn>author</dfn> reminds you that <dfn>communing</dfn> is the effect of other verbs, not an <dfn>action</dfn> you can undertake yourself. You do it by <dfn>putting things inside you</dfn>, in whatever manner befits their nature.</p>

<p class="prompt">Put a chicken inside of yourself, then </p>
<p>You <dfn>eat</dfn> a <dfn>live chicken</dfn>. <dfn>sweetie belle</dfn> and <dfn>applebloom</dfn> are both slightly <dfn>unnerved</dfn> at your gratuitous display of <dfn>geekery</dfn>.</p>

<p>You now know <dfn>terrorMAJIKKX</dfn>, but are only really sure how to apply them to <dfn>yourself</dfn>. You are suddenly grateful that you emptied your bladder <dfn>earlier</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Open the mailbox, retrieve muffin-scented mail.</p>
<p>You <dfn>locate</dfn> the <dfn>muffin-scented mail</dfn>. It is <dfn>sealed with the royal crest</dfn>, and apparently addressed to <dfn>Big Macintosh</dfn>. I <dfn>kind of forget what happened to him</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Try not to get locked in the apple cellar by Big Macintosh</p>
<p>I believe you <dfn>ate him</dfn> in the previous <dfn>session</dfn>. He will not be much of a <dfn>threat</dfn>.</p>

<p>You <dfn>eat applebloom</dfn>. You are beginning to wonder if <dfn>all the apples will be eaten in this game</dfn>.</p>

<p><dfn>applebloom</dfn> knocks on your <dfn>stomach lining</dfn> quite <dfn>vigorously</dfn>, pointing out that you <dfn>forgot to chew</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Get applejack to eat all of the apples</p>
<p>You <dfn>convince applejack</dfn> to <dfn>consume her entire family</dfn>, <dfn>including</dfn>, <dfn>because of the strict rules of set theory</dfn>, <dfn>herself</dfn>.</p>

<p>Because <dfn>applebloom</dfn> is currently inside of you, <dfn>applejack</dfn> eats you as well.</p>

<p>You are now <dfn>in applejack</dfn>.</p>

<p>You see an <dfn>applebloom</dfn> here.</p>

<p>You see an <dfn>applejack</dfn> here.</p>

<p>(&hellip;wat.)</p>

<p class="prompt">enter the apple cellar</p>
<p>You <dfn>enter applejack'</dfn>s "<dfn>cellar</dfn>." It's <dfn>just as filthy</dfn> in there as <dfn>you feel</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt question">Is the <dfn>apple cellar</dfn> just <dfn>applejack'</dfn>s <dfn>intestines</dfn>?</p>
<p>It is A <dfn>bit lower</dfn>.</p>

<p>(It really does. We oughtta get out of this pony and get some shit done. &hellip;yes, every word of that was intended to cause literal commands.)</p>

<p class="prompt">Get some shit done</p>
<p>You <dfn>finish</dfn> the <dfn>shit</dfn>, which looked to be quite <dfn>undone</dfn> previously. <dfn>applejack</dfn> is <dfn>grateful</dfn> for the <dfn>bodily assistance</dfn>. <dfn>Loki</dfn> is somewhat <dfn>squicked</dfn>.</p>

<p>You <dfn>take</dfn> the <dfn>string</dfn> "Out of this pony". It contains 128 bits of <dfn>negentropy</dfn>.</p>

<p><dfn>good job on earning some finally jeez</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Consider putting the string back into the pony</p>
<p>You consider putting the string back into Applejack, but instead put it into your <dfn>inventorial bullshittery mechanism</dfn>, where it obviously belongs.</p>

<p class="prompt">exit applejack via the cellar, being sure to bring applebloom with you.</p>
<p>You get <dfn>vagued out</dfn> of <dfn>applejack</dfn>. As does <dfn>applebloom</dfn>.

<p class="prompt">Use a free internext proxy to access GameFAQs.</p>

<p>You <dfn>attempt to scratch your eye</dfn>, even though all ponies are told from the time they are babies to <dfn>never try to do such clumsy things with</dfn> A <dfn>hoof</dfn>. You <dfn>never got those kind of parent-child bonding moments</dfn>, <dfn>okay</dfn>?</p>

<p class="prompt">enter own brain and look at room</p>
<p>It is <dfn>disgusting</dfn>, <dfn>vile</dfn>, and <dfn>filthy</dfn> in here. It is also incredibly <dfn>vague</dfn>. But it has always been these things. It's your brain, after all.</p>

<p class="prompt">touch and prod room walls and listen</p>
<p>You <dfn>touch</dfn> everything. One by one, you recall <dfn>memories</dfn> and <dfn>scents</dfn> and <dfn>visceral pleasures</dfn> in a way that <dfn>totally isn't the way brains work</dfn>.</p>

<p>In the distance, you hear <dfn>thunderous clopping</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">attempt to self-reflect in a metaphorically physical way à la psychonauts</p>
<p>You sit in a small <dfn>chair</dfn> that has somehow materialized in a <dfn>metaphorical</dfn> way upon your <dfn>theatre of the mind</dfn>. A <dfn>large metal thingy</dfn> sticks you in the <dfn>neck</dfn>, and you find that it allows you to <dfn>pilot your own body like</dfn> A <dfn>homunculus</dfn>. You aren't sure how this is <dfn>any better than how things were before</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">strain ears toward thunderous noise</p>
<p>Paying close attention, you realize that it is the sum of the memories of <dfn>every time you have ever done anything vague</dfn> coming in through a nearby <dfn>access panel</dfn>. The <dfn>panel</dfn> has a <dfn>switch</dfn> and <dfn>two dials</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">X panel</p>
<p>The <dfn>panel</dfn> is dull grey, with <dfn>the written form of horse noises</dfn> printed all along its top half. The <dfn>switch</dfn> is labelled with an <dfn>iconographic representation of an eye</dfn>. One <dfn>dial</dfn> is <dfn>labelled</dfn> with the <dfn>english word</dfn> "Gain". The other remains <dfn>unlabelled</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Lu: use computing device to access http://piratepad.net/Jtyjiqlndj</p>
<p>    (><dfn>Odin and</dfn>/<dfn>or Loki</dfn>: Make that ^^ <dfn>possible</dfn> using your <dfn>godly might and</dfn>/<dfn>or tomfoolery</dfn>.)</p>
<p>The <dfn>author</dfn> seems to have problems establishing a <dfn>dual connection</dfn> to <dfn>piratepad</dfn> in a way that <dfn>ietherpad</dfn> was perfectly comfortable with. Perhaps <dfn>someone else</dfn> can be <dfn>Lu</dfn> if they <dfn>like</dfn>.</p>

<p>This action <dfn>fails</dfn> for <dfn>unknown reasons</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Lu: have existential crisis, then attempt to help win your own game.</p>
<p>You <dfn>freak out</dfn> due to your <dfn>inability to draw an acyclic representation of your own current situation</dfn>. You then <dfn>attempt to help the player</dfn>, but are saddened to realize that the <dfn>communication channel is one-way</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Lu: ponder possible quest and objectives, and choose most interesting point of advancement to begin your epic journey towards best ending.</p>
<p><dfn>the author</dfn> decides to <dfn>introduce new problems</dfn> to be <dfn>solved</dfn>. The <dfn>below</dfn> is <dfn>merely one of them</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Gingerly flip switch on panel</p>
<p>You <dfn>flip the switch</dfn>.</p>

<p>You <dfn>can't see</dfn>!</p>

<p class="prompt">twist the pair of dials all the way up to eleven</p>
<p>You <dfn>twist</dfn> the <dfn>dials clockwise</dfn>, <dfn>assuming</dfn> that <dfn>eleven</dfn> would be a <dfn>marking of their furthest extent and then some</dfn>. You find that <dfn>the noise carrying throughout your mind has changed</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">G</p>
<p>The <dfn>switch</dfn> has seemingly <dfn>ceased to exist</dfn>. You cannot <dfn>feel</dfn> it on the <dfn>panel surface</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">listen to panel</p>
<p>The <dfn>noise</dfn> is now a <dfn>dull</dfn>, <dfn>intense hum</dfn>. It gives you a <dfn>headache</dfn>, which probably will cause some sort of <dfn>amusing literal effect</dfn> on your surroundings.</p>

<p class="prompt">look</p>
<p>You <dfn>can't see</dfn>!</p>
<p>&hellip;inside your head.</p>

<p>You see an <dfn>apple farm</dfn>. I believe that was where we <dfn>last left off previously</dfn>.</p>

<p>It is, however, <dfn>slightly blurry</dfn>. You are unsure whether this is a <dfn>perceptual effect</dfn>, or if something has gone <dfn>horribly wrong with the universe</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Gingerly twist gain knob clockwise</p>
<p>The <dfn>gain</dfn> knob is already at its <dfn>furthest clockwise extent</dfn>, because that is what I assumed you meant by <dfn>eleven</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Inner Lu: Gingerly twist gain knob counterclockwise</p>
<p>You <dfn>twist</dfn> the <dfn>gain knob</dfn> back A <dfn>bit</dfn>. The <dfn>world comes into focus</dfn>. The <dfn>hum</dfn> also <dfn>decreases</dfn>. You wonder what <dfn>the point of that was</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Inner Lu: listen for thunderous noise</p>
<p>The <dfn>thunderous noise</dfn> is gone. Instead, you can hear <dfn>songs of merriment and joviality</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Inner Lu: Gingerly twist unlabelled knob counterclockwise</p>
<p>You <dfn>twist</dfn> the <dfn>other knob</dfn> around, and <dfn>hope that something interesting will occur</dfn>. The <dfn>sound</dfn> seems to <dfn>change like</dfn> A <dfn>radio</dfn>, though everything you hear is <dfn>intensely familiar</dfn>.</p>

<p>You <dfn>still can't see</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Inner Lu: again</p>

<p>You <dfn>twist</dfn> the <dfn>knob</dfn> like it <dfn>owes you money</dfn>. Eventually, you find a "<dfn>station</dfn>" that is <dfn>broadcasting some sort of conversation that you feel you should listen in on</dfn>. You <dfn>stop twisting</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">listen in on</p>

<p>"Dragons? Why Dragons?"</p>

<p>"Because the world does not have <dfn>enough</dfn> Dragons. They have been <dfn>depleted</dfn>!"</p>

<p>"But that's no reason to&hellip; really, this is <dfn>madness</dfn>."</p>

<p>"Stop capitalizing words. This isn't narrative."</p>

<p>"But you just did it twice."</p>

<p>"&hellip; Anyway. Once you have completed the <dfn>preparations</dfn>&hellip; oops. The preparations, release the &hellip;thing. I'm not going to say its name, in case there is someone who feels that they should <dfn>listen in on</dfn> this. &hellip;oops again."</p>

<p>"You're quite paranoid for a <dfn>not-so-mad scientist</dfn>."</p>

<p><dfn>---</p>

<p>You found that conversation <dfn>extremely dumb</dfn>. However, since it was a <dfn>cutscene</dfn>, you have just earned yourself +67 points.</p>
<p>Also, your <dfn>frustgruntlement</dfn> is <dfn>maxxed</dfn>, if you want to fire it off any time soon.</p>

<p class="prompt">Inner Lu: check for more stations</p>
<p>You <dfn>turn</dfn> the <dfn>knob</dfn>, but it seems that the <dfn>device</dfn> has outlived its usefulness and become an <dfn>obsolete device</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">take out your frustgruntlement on your pituitary gland</p>
<p>You <dfn>strike</dfn> your <dfn>pituitary gland</dfn> with all your <dfn>filly might</dfn>. Your <dfn>heart</dfn> grows <dfn>three sizes</dfn> that day. And then <dfn>explodes</dfn>, killing you.</p>

<p>Undo?</p>

<p class="prompt">Y</p>

<p>Your <dfn>heart</dfn> un-explodes. You are <dfn>alive</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Inner Lu: listen</p>
<p>The <dfn>station</dfn> is now stuck on <dfn>the sound coming from the audial sensory organs of the outer Lu</dfn>, which seems like a much more <dfn>reasonable function</dfn> for the <dfn>device</dfn>. Perhaps it is not as <dfn>obsolete</dfn> as first examination might <dfn>reveal</dfn>.</p>


<p class="prompt">Inner Lu: turn gain dial one more time</p>
<p>You <dfn>turn the gain dial counterclockwise</dfn>, since <dfn>turning</dfn> it <dfn>clockwise</dfn> resulted in a lot of <dfn>useless stuff</dfn> happening.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, you somehow also experience the sensation of <dfn>being the outer Lu</dfn>, and <dfn>having your majjikweak interactions</dfn> forcefully <dfn>broken down</dfn>. It is oddly <dfn>painless</dfn>, but you have a feeling that turning the knob <dfn>further</dfn> might <dfn>destroy the universe</dfn>. You are <dfn>ambivalent</dfn> about this option.</p>

<p class="prompt">Inner Lu: think about dragons and mad scientists</p>
<p>It <dfn>strikes you</dfn> that this is a <dfn>fairly accurate description</dfn> of <dfn>twilight sparkle pony</dfn> and <dfn>Spike</dfn>.</p>

<p>You're <dfn>pretty sure</dfn> it's <dfn>not them</dfn>, though.</p>

<p class="prompt">Inner Lu: attempt to match voices from conversation with princess Celestia and Luna</p>
<p>They are <dfn>not those voices</dfn>. They actually <dfn>are</dfn> the voices of <dfn>twilight sparkle pony</dfn> and <dfn>Spike</dfn>, but like you said, they aren't <dfn>acting</dfn> like them enough for it to be <dfn>the ones you know</dfn>. For one thing, that <dfn>Spike</dfn> didn't sound all that <dfn>pathetic</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt comment">I finally caught up! :D(yay!)</p>
<p class="prompt">Inner Lu: turn gain dial once more</p>
<p>You <dfn>turn the gain dial all the way to the left</dfn>. The <dfn>universal majjikweak force ceases to exist</dfn>. <dfn>majtomic nuclei fly apart at the speed of light</dfn>. You think this is all rather <dfn>beautiful</dfn>, in a strictly <dfn>aesthetic</dfn> sense. Miss Pinkamina, her mind suddenly available due to the re-merging of all material throughout the universe, <dfn>agrees</dfn>.</p>

<p><dfn>Odin</dfn> has unlocked <dfn>achievement</dfn> "<dfn>foom</dfn>."</p>

<p class="prompt">undo</p>
<p>You, <dfn>Odin</dfn>, <dfn>undo</dfn>. You retain the <dfn>achievement</dfn>, however.</p>

<p class="prompt">Flip switch back to its origianal position [It's gone, somehow now.](oh right)</p>
<p>You <dfn>flip</dfn> the nonexistent <dfn>switch</dfn>.</p>

<p>Suddenly, you <dfn>can see</dfn>!</p>

<p>That was some pretty intense <dfn>tomfoolery</dfn>.</p>

<p>You wonder who was responsible for that. Maybe the <dfn>god of tomfoolery</dfn> is getting bored while <dfn>Odin</dfn> is playing the game?</p>


<p class="prompt">Odin: scratch itchy empty eye socket.</p>
<p>You <dfn>cannot do this</dfn>, as your <dfn>arms are much too heavy and manly to lift off your keyboard</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Odin: command one of your crows to scratch your eye socket.</p>
<p>You <dfn>do so</dfn>. The <dfn>crow</dfn> is <dfn>consumed into the abyss that is your eye of eternal night</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Inner Lu: Gingerly adjust both knobs in a way that seems optimally harmonious</p>
<p>You <dfn>luck out</dfn> and <dfn>solve the puzzle</dfn> without the <dfn>players</dfn> having to do much more than sit around and <dfn>hee-haw</dfn> to themselves like <dfn>insipid donkeys</dfn>.</p>

<p>It <dfn>turns out</dfn> that with the <dfn>gain</dfn> turned <dfn>down</dfn>, adjusting the <dfn>unlabelled knob</dfn> affects your <dfn>surroundings</dfn> in a way resembling <dfn>dimensional sliding</dfn>. You are <dfn>unsure</dfn> why that is something your <dfn>mind</dfn> is capable of.</p>

<p>(<dfn>the players</dfn> know that it is because <dfn>protagonists</dfn> have access to <dfn>all features</dfn> of the <dfn>simulation</dfn> as long as they are <dfn>aware</dfn> of them, and <dfn>believe</dfn> themselves to be <dfn>capable</dfn> of affecting them.)</p>

<p class="prompt comment">That occurs to me to be a Big Security Hole in its design; Bruce Schneier would have an aneurysm if that actually happened.</p>
<p>(The <dfn>protagonist</dfn> only has access to userland features; the <dfn>maintainers</dfn> have access to kernel configuration hooks; and it takes both working together to do something like a <dfn>reboot</dfn>.)</p>

<p class="prompt comment">XD</p>

<p class="prompt">search your brain to see if you might find some clues about earning your cutie mark [excellent idea]</p>
<p>You <dfn>search</dfn>. Your <dfn>brain</dfn>, however, does not seem to be a <dfn>library</dfn> so much as a <dfn>bunch of wires and doo-dads</dfn>. You wish the <dfn>metaphor</dfn> could be <dfn>extended</dfn> A <dfn>slight bit</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">rearange the wires until you feel horny</p>

<p>Undo?</p>

<p class="prompt">yes, but still become horny</p>
<p>You <dfn>reset your brain back to</dfn> A <dfn>resonable facsimile of health</dfn>. It is still, however, <dfn>very dirty</dfn>.</p>

<p><dfn>the pony fandom is shocked by her uncaring usage of lgbt terminology</dfn>, <dfn>and likens her to orson scott card in</dfn> A <dfn>complete overreaction</dfn>.</p>


<p>This <dfn>hurts her feelings so bad you don't even know</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt comment">My cousins totally know <dfn>orson scott card</dfn>, and interacted with him often. Also, lol.</p>

<p>But everything is different in little ways, of course.</p>

<p class="prompt">stop being lazy and describe "everything" by: look</p>
<p>There are no longer a <dfn>buckton</dfn> of <dfn>apples</dfn> on the <dfn>ground</dfn>. Instead, there are <dfn>alters</dfn> of <dfn>sweetie belle</dfn> and <dfn>applebloom</dfn>, quietly having a <dfn>tea party</dfn>, dressed in <dfn>little froo-froo dresses</dfn>. You realize that this is one of those <dfn>stories where the protagonist never meets themselves</dfn>, which is <dfn>disappointing</dfn>, because you were <dfn>still pretty horny</dfn>.</p>

<p>You still seem to have your <dfn>chafing</dfn>, because the <dfn>inventorious bullshittery device</dfn> is just so much <dfn>tomfoolery</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Tsutsu: scream at managing at least three threads of thought while maintaining a story's plot and grammar in the wee hours of the dawn</p>
<p><dfn>waaaaaaaaagh</dfn>! /ork</p>

<p class="prompt">Lu: greet the alters of sweetie belle and applebloom</p>
<p>You <dfn>greet sweaty bell</dfn> and <dfn>orangebum</dfn>, as <dfn>you call them</dfn>. They find your <dfn>lack of</dfn> A <dfn>frilly froo-froo dress</dfn> most <dfn>disquieting</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">player Ace2401: resume trolling the game</p>
<p>He <dfn>does so</dfn>. It is <dfn>hilarious</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Loki player 2/cupcakes pinke: introduce yourself to Loki player 1/lauren faust pony. describe your favorite activity (i.e. torture, murder, and cannibalism.)</p>
<p>You <dfn>disgust lauren faust</dfn>, but her <dfn>professionalism</dfn> is <dfn>always maximum</dfn>. She does not <dfn>react</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt question">What about when <dfn>lauren faust pony</dfn> did <dfn>react</dfn>?</p>
<p><dfn>lauren faust pony</dfn> was making a <dfn>joke</dfn>, that was not <dfn>well-received</dfn>. She <dfn>shrugs</dfn>. "Sometimes it happens," she <dfn>neighs</dfn>.</p>



<p class="prompt">Lu: check if the alters' bodies are flat like poorly made pillows.</p>
<p>They <dfn>are not</dfn>. However, they seem to be <dfn>fatter</dfn> and <dfn>rounder</dfn> than the <dfn>average pony</dfn>, to the point that only the shapes of their <dfn>frilly froo-froo</dfn> garments are preventing their appearance from being almost entirely <dfn>spherical</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Lu: ask the alters the kind of typical and yet topical npc questions that a human would find in a typical dialogue tree in a 21th century earth rpg.</p>
<p>You <dfn>try to find somepony with an exclaimation point over their head</dfn> so you can <dfn>get this show on the road</dfn>. It <dfn>works middlingly well</dfn>; <dfn>orangebum</dfn>, who had an <dfn>interrobang</dfn> over her <dfn>head</dfn>, <dfn>tells you in startled tones</dfn> that you must be the <dfn>chosen one</dfn> out to <dfn>save the world</dfn> from the impending <dfn>thing</dfn>.</p>

<p>It's all <dfn>very corny</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Lu: examine chafing and ponder its function, which it must have thanks to conservation of detail.</p>
<p>The <dfn>chafing</dfn> is an <dfn>idol</dfn> for some <dfn>cruel alien god</dfn>. You wonder if is somehow <dfn>MAJIKKal</dfn>.</p>


<p class="prompt">Lu: Ask for more context about the impending thing, but attempt to keep conversation relevant to the macro-level plot.</p>
<p><dfn>orangebum</dfn> informs you that nopony in the <dfn>first few towns</dfn> ever knows much about the <dfn>impending thing</dfn>. You should probably go <dfn>through the wilderness</dfn> to <dfn>reach the place with way better equipment and shops</dfn>, where they <dfn>deal with impending things all the time</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Lu: ask for information on the wilderness</p>
<p><dfn>orangebum</dfn> points over to the <dfn>everfree forest</dfn>, which is <dfn>obviously what she was referring to</dfn>. She shivers slightly as she remembers her interaction with the <dfn>chubblanks</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Lu: journey through as a noble savage while describing the bucolic everfree forest with effusive 19th-century romanticism-style imagery</p>
<p>You wonder whether you should <dfn>take other party members along</dfn>. <dfn>orangebum</dfn> and <dfn>sweaty bell</dfn> seem less-than-effective. (Y/N)</p>

<p class="prompt">Y</p>
<p>You <dfn>take orangebum</dfn> and <dfn>sweaty bell</dfn>. They are <dfn>added to your inventory</dfn> in a <dfn>masterstroke of tomfoolery</dfn>. You're <dfn>really getting good at this</dfn>.</p>

<p>You <dfn>venture forth</dfn> into the <dfn>forest</dfn>. It turns out to be <dfn>too dark to see much at all</dfn>, and so the only <dfn>description</dfn> for most of the <dfn>journey</dfn> is that the <dfn>ground</dfn> is quite <dfn>rough</dfn> and that <dfn>sweaty bell</dfn> lives up to her <dfn>name</dfn>.</p>

<p>You arrive at the <dfn>port city of los ungulates</dfn>. You wonder where <dfn>they keep getting these pun names from</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">recall the greater goal in order to avoid getting swept up in local politics and intrigue and side-quests for the next five years.</p>
<p>You <dfn>skip</dfn>, <dfn>like</dfn>, <dfn>seven chapters</dfn> of <dfn>the name of the wind by patrick rothfuss</dfn>. <dfn>it turns out that you missed nothing</dfn>.</p>

<p>You <dfn>find</dfn> a <dfn>helpful tavern-wench</dfn>, who <dfn>directs you back to ponyville</dfn> in a display of <dfn>stupid game design</dfn> the likes of which have not been seen since <dfn>final fantasy</dfn> 1.</p>

<p class="prompt">cupcakes pinkie: find and confer with miss pinkamina. resist the temptation to kill her and eat her. </p>
<p>You <dfn>resist for</dfn> A <dfn>while</dfn>. By the time your <dfn>powerful id</dfn> takes <dfn>absolute control</dfn> of you, Miss Pinkamina has <dfn>already tied you up</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">X library</p>
<p>The <dfn>library</dfn> in this <dfn>dimension</dfn> seems to be a standard <dfn>evil lair</dfn>, replete with A <dfn>basement full of useless chemistry equipment</dfn> that itself contains <dfn>flasks full of food coloring</dfn>, and also a few <dfn>tesla coils</dfn> for <dfn>atmosphere</dfn>. The <dfn>doors</dfn> are <dfn>dark and forebOding</dfn>, but that's probably just because <dfn>twilight sparkle pony never dusts</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt comment">Even vacuum tubes‽</p>
<p><dfn>muahahahaha</dfn>!</p>

<p class="prompt">sniff the air</p>
<p>The <dfn>air</dfn> smells of <dfn>ozone</dfn> from the movement of <dfn>mechanical relay switches</dfn>, which are also probably for <dfn>atmosphere</dfn> as things like <dfn>hooftops</dfn> have long existed. It has no scent of <dfn>vagueness</dfn> or <dfn>really good shit</dfn>, which is surprising and a bit <dfn>unsettling</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">listen for enemies</p>
<p>You <dfn>hear</dfn> a <dfn>clatter of hoofbeats</dfn> coming from <dfn>behind</dfn> you, but know that it is merely <dfn>orangebum</dfn> and <dfn>sweaty bell</dfn> making a <dfn>deleterious commotion</dfn> in their new <dfn>doubleshoes</dfn>. There are <dfn>no traces of henchmen</dfn>, which is <dfn>disappointing</dfn>, because you wanted to use <dfn>chafing</dfn> as a <dfn>bludgeon</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">get ready to use chafing as a bludgeon</p>
<p>You <dfn>get chafing ready anyway</dfn>. You <dfn>like the heft</dfn> of it. You take a <dfn>test swing</dfn> in <dfn>sweaty bell'</dfn>s <dfn>direction</dfn>, causing her to <dfn>indent</dfn> like some sort of <dfn>rubber duck</dfn>. She takes <dfn>no damage</dfn>.</p>

<p>If this is the same kind of thing that this reality's <dfn>twilight sparkle pony</dfn> is made from, you might have something to worry about after all.</p>


<p class="prompt">be confused. then have sex with sweaty belle and orangebum </p>
<p>You are now <dfn>player</dfn>: <dfn>confused guy</dfn>. (Sorry)</p>

<p class="prompt">Lu: have sex with sweaty belle and orangebum to rub it in confused guy's face</p>
<p>Oh, okay.</p>
<p>You press their <dfn>oddly-round bodies together</dfn> and <dfn>insert your vagueness</dfn> between them. Much <dfn>squeaking</dfn> can be heard. It's just sort of <dfn>weird</dfn>, and not really that pleasant at all.</p>

<p class="prompt">enjoy it anyway because you are that filthy-minded</p>
<p>You <dfn>revel</dfn> in your <dfn>filth</dfn>. Which <dfn>reminds me</dfn>: <dfn>sweaty bell</dfn> and <dfn>orangebum</dfn> are now <dfn>filthy</dfn>. The <dfn>chafing</dfn>, however, is <dfn>immune</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">tsutsu: describe you frustgruntlement at the players (namely ace2401) for just commanding sex scenes and derailing the plot all the time.</p>
<p>My <dfn>frustgruntlement</dfn> is not just <dfn>always maximum</dfn>. It's&hellip;</p>

<p class="prompt">Tsutsu: deus ex machina [type: plot advance]</p>
<p>You are now <dfn>inside the library</dfn>. Wasn't that hard, right?</p>

<p class="prompt">Inner Lu: down</p>
<p>You are now <dfn>inside your own neck</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">examine medulla oblongata</p>
<p>You <dfn>examine it</dfn>. Since you are not sure <dfn>which part of the body that is</dfn>, you just <dfn>gander about</dfn> in <dfn>bemused silence</dfn>. It occurs to you that, if you sat back in your <dfn>mind chair</dfn> right now, you could have a <dfn>totally awesome climactic fight</dfn> as if you were some sort of <dfn>giant robot pilot</dfn> piloting <dfn>yourself</dfn>. </p>

<p>Then you realize how <dfn>inane</dfn> that idea is.</p>

<p>While you are waltzing around your own <dfn>insides</dfn>, a <dfn>fifty-pound spider</dfn> has found its way onto <dfn>your face</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">down more</p>
<p>You <dfn>enter your own stomach</dfn>, breaking a ton of rules about <dfn>what parts of the body you can visit from your brain</dfn>. Hey, it's not like you aren't almost a <dfn>god of tomfoolery yourself</dfn> by now.</p>

<p class="prompt">tsutsu: perform a significantly hurtful action to ace2401 to empty your frustgruntlement and return it to minimum.</p>
<p>Ace2401: nah. I don't <dfn>feel</dfn> like it.</p>


<p class="prompt">down more</p>
<p>You <dfn>poop yourself out</dfn>. What a <dfn>wild</dfn>, <dfn>strange trip it's been</dfn>.</p>

<p>You are now a <dfn>tiny Lu</dfn> in the <dfn>library</dfn>, standing beside the <dfn>front-left hoof</dfn> of a <dfn>regular-sized Lu</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Both Lus: make eye contact</p>
<p>From your perspective as <dfn>tiny Lu</dfn>, <dfn>regular-sized Lu</dfn> looks <dfn>incredibly embarrassed</dfn>, and <dfn>slightly worried</dfn>, because she did not previously think that she was <dfn>as incontinent as sweaty bell</dfn>. She also looks to have a <dfn>fifty-pound spider</dfn> on her <dfn>face</dfn>.</p>

<p>From your perspective as <dfn>regular-sized Lu</dfn>, you&mdash;<dfn>ahhhhhghghgh spider</p>

<p class="prompt">Regular Lu: Use sweaty belle or orangewhatever to destroy or remove spider by any means</p>
<p>You, <dfn>regular Lu</dfn>, are <dfn>incapacitated</dfn> by your <dfn>self-application</dfn> of <dfn>terrorMAJIKKX</dfn>. However, you are <dfn>completely safe</dfn> as long as your <dfn>terror</dfn> remains at <dfn>maximum</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Tiny Lu: enter the chafing</p>
<p>You run up your <dfn>more brobdignagian self'</dfn>s <dfn>leg</dfn> until you reach the <dfn>chafing</dfn>, tucked <dfn>somewhere indeterminable</dfn> (but not at all <dfn>vague</dfn>) inside the <dfn>inventorious bullshittery device</dfn>. You <dfn>enter</dfn> it.</p>

<p>You are now <dfn>inside the spider</dfn>. &hellip;wait, <dfn>what</dfn>?</p>

<p class="prompt">wait what</p>
<p>You <dfn>wait</dfn> for the larger <dfn>Lu</dfn> to echo your cry of <dfn>equine confusion</dfn>. It turns out to take <dfn>precisely two-point-seven seconds</dfn>.</p>


<p class="prompt">player ace2401: use tomfoolery to postulate where the inventorious bullshittery device device is. roll a six-sided die to test your hypothesis</p>
<p>You make A <dfn>number of postulations</dfn>, then <dfn>pick one at random</dfn>. It turns out to be <dfn>entirely incorrect</dfn>.</p>
<p class="prompt comment">The prior was way too low</p>

<p class="prompt">player ace2401: guess that the inventorious bullshittery device is in the ear.</p>
<p>That was <dfn>pretty much what you guessed the first time</dfn>. It is <dfn>no more correct now that it is explicit</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt comment">I was following your directions above, so that was meant to be the first time. meta tomfoolery ftw XD</p>
<p>(ahh)</p>

<p class="prompt">Tiny Lu: selfxspider</p>
<p class="prompt comment">That's <dfn>my</dfn> job!</p>
<p>From inside the <dfn>spider</dfn>, you <dfn>cannot access</dfn> its <dfn>vagueness</dfn>. You should <dfn>swing around back</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Tiny Lu: X self/spider</p>
<p>You <dfn>have no sense of being physically inside the spider</dfn>. Instead, you have merely taken <dfn>complete mental control</dfn> of it. Everything is <dfn>bigger</dfn> and&hellip; <dfn>seven</dfn>. It seems that the spider is <dfn>missing one eye</dfn>.</p>
<p class="prompt comment">i c wut u did thar</p>

<p class="prompt">ll: Retrieve arms from inventorious bullshittery device</p>
<p>Due to the <dfn>tomfoolery</dfn> of the <dfn>inventorious bullshittery device</dfn>, You manage to <dfn>grow two orange-coated pony arms</dfn> from your <dfn>arachnid frame</dfn>. It is <dfn>messed up</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">grow pony head from inventorious bullshittery device</p>
<p>You <dfn>grow</dfn> A <dfn>head</dfn> out of the <dfn>spider</dfn>. However, this separates your <dfn>semantic construct</dfn> from the spider's <dfn>tracked mental context</dfn>. The <dfn>spider</dfn> curls in on itself and <dfn>eats your head</dfn>.</p>

<p>You've met with a <dfn>terrible fate</dfn>, haven't you?</p>
<p class="prompt comment">i c wut u did thar 2</p>

<p class="prompt">undo</p>
<p>You are <dfn>no longer two-headed</dfn>. You are merely <dfn>one pony</dfn> occupying <dfn>three distinct bodies</dfn>. This does not seem <dfn>all that much better</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">grow pegasus wings from inventorious bullshittery device</p>
<p>You <dfn>do so</dfn>. You are now a <dfn>flying spider</dfn>. Millions of people from Reddit <dfn>burn down their houses</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Big Lu: pick up spider</p>
<p>Big Lu is still frozen in <dfn>terror</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Tiny Lu: stop raping big Lu's face (and try not to get squished by big Lu)</p>
<p>You <dfn>push off</dfn> of your <dfn>doppel</dfn> and <dfn>fall</dfn> to the ground, scurrying under a <dfn>shelf</dfn> as you (the other you) <dfn>unfreezes</dfn> and begins to release her built-up <dfn>frustgruntlement</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Big Lu:  use chafing as a bludgeon to kill the flying spider to death. continue to bludgeon the flying spider just to make sure it's dead.</p>
<p>You <dfn>cannot access</dfn> the <dfn>chafing</dfn>, because you (the other you) are currently <dfn>inside</dfn> of it. This is the first time that the <dfn>inventorious bullshittery device</dfn> has lived up to its name.</p>

<p class="prompt">use hooves to stomp it to death and then some instead</p>
<p>You <dfn>perform</dfn> A <dfn>riverdance of death</dfn>. But, instead of squishing the <dfn>massive spider</dfn>, you merely <dfn>squish sweaty bell</dfn>, who <dfn>wrings out</dfn> like a <dfn>moistened sponge</dfn> in reaction.</p>

<p class="prompt">Tiny Lu: attempt to communicate with big Lu</p>
<p>You <dfn>already are</dfn>, though both of you have been <dfn>ignoring</dfn> the 2.7-second-delayed <dfn>psychic echo</dfn> due to having <dfn>separate goals</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Meta-player: check game progress</p>
<p>You, <dfn>Odin</dfn>, are currently <dfn>sucking hard</dfn>, and failing to do anything about the <dfn>impending thing</dfn>. You also seem to have forgotten that the <dfn>fifty-pound spider</dfn> is a <dfn>perceptual smear</dfn>, and actually possesses most of the properties of a <dfn>book</dfn> called "How to <dfn>defend</dfn>."</p>

<p class="prompt">player ace2401: check game trolling level</p>
<p>You, Player: Ace2401, currently have 63 TrollPoints that can be <dfn>redeemed</dfn> at the nearest TrollMart or Canadian Tire.</p>

<p>You do not have a local TrollMart!</p>

<p>You do, however, have a Canadian Tire.</p>

<p class="prompt">player ace2401: buy a  diablo ex machina (subject: everything) from a your local Canadia tire.</p>
<p>Canadian Tire does not sell <dfn>diablo ex machina</dfn>. Instead, it sells Daeboulou Eh Machina. You <dfn>buy one of those</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt question">Does a  Daeboulou Eh Machina have the same effects as a <dfn>diablo ex machina</dfn>?</p>
<p><dfn>no</dfn>. But you should still <dfn>have fun with it</dfn>.</p>

<p>You <dfn>pick up</dfn> yourself.</p>
<p>You were already carrying <dfn>sweaty bell</dfn> and <dfn>orangebum</dfn>, so you <dfn>drop</dfn> them, just to have an opportunity to <dfn>pick them up again</dfn>.</p>

<p><dfn>twilight sparkle pony'</dfn>s <dfn>voice</dfn> can be heard from <dfn>down</dfn>stairs, which you were probably trying to get to A <dfn>while ago</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">follow twilight to ask about the impending thing to somehow in the end better deal with the conversation you heard in your brain which is hopefully the end goal.</p>
<p>You <dfn>go downstairs</dfn> to the <dfn>cliche-of-evil laboratory</dfn>.</p>
<p>Also, <dfn>it is</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">look</p>
<p>The <dfn>laboratory</dfn> is <dfn>full of irrelevant science junk</dfn>, that you <dfn>nonetheless know the names for</dfn>, having worked so long with Miss Pinkamina. Most of it seems to be <dfn>hooked up wrong</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">talk to twilight sparkle pony about the impending thing and the conversation you had in your brain</p>
<p>You <dfn>do</dfn>. She says that she <dfn>knew</dfn> somepony would be <dfn>listening in</dfn> to her <dfn>evil plotting</dfn>. She also says that <dfn>you cannot stop the impending thing</dfn>, because she has the <dfn>big red button</dfn> sitting <dfn>right there</dfn> beside her.</p>

<p><dfn>twilight sparkle pony</dfn> has used the <dfn>trappings</dfn> of <dfn>cliched villainy</dfn> to <dfn>fool you</dfn>. She <dfn>cuts herself off</dfn> and <dfn>presses the button immediately</dfn>.</p>

<p>You notice that <dfn>Spike</dfn> was in a <dfn>cage</dfn> on the <dfn>table</dfn> the entire time. You guess he was kind of <dfn>irrelevant and boring</dfn> before this moment. <dfn>twilight sparkle pony watches him intently</dfn>.</p>

<p>Nothing happens.</p>

<p><dfn>twilight sparkle pony stamps her feet</dfn>. (<dfn>the ones she picked off of the wild rarity</dfn>.)</p>

<p>Nothing happens.</p>

<p>You cannot reach the <dfn>giant green button</dfn>. It is on the <dfn>ceiling</dfn>, in the reverse of the position of the <dfn>giant red button</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">use pegasus wings to fly </p>
<p>You don't have the clearance to do your regular <dfn>running jump</dfn> into the air. So instead you just <dfn>hover uselessly</dfn>.</p>

<p>The <dfn>author</dfn> reminds you of the <dfn>square-cube law</dfn>.</p>


<p class="prompt">X twilight sparkle pony(?)</p>
<p><dfn>twilight sparkle dragon</dfn> is just sitting there being boring and <dfn>evil</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">X room around green button</p>
<p>The room is <dfn>vertically mirrored</dfn>, such that everything that exists on the floor also exists on the ceiling. The cage on the ceiling, however, is <dfn>empty</dfn>. You and <dfn>twilight</dfn> aren't up there either.</p>

<p class="prompt">indicate mirror and make bad reference to twilight being A vampire</p>
<p>Not a chance.</p>

<p class="prompt">player ace2401: ignore the above and continue pretending that the twilight books never existed.</p>
<p>You <dfn>do so</dfn>. <dfn>twilight sparkle dragon</dfn>, however, seems <dfn>incapable</dfn> of <dfn>pretending</dfn> any longer. It is probably what set her on this path to <dfn>unseemly</dfn> and <dfn>unenjoyable behavior</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">X red button</p>
<p>You look at the <dfn>red button</dfn>. It has been <dfn>pressed</dfn>, and has not <dfn>restored</dfn> to its original, <dfn>pressable</dfn> position. It's probably not going to be doing anything else but being <dfn>shiny</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">X caged Spike</p>
<p><dfn>Spike</dfn> is, and always was, a <dfn>dragon</dfn>. You wonder what <dfn>twilight sparkle pony</dfn> was expecting to <dfn>observe</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">shout "You'll never win!" to twilight sparkle dragon</p>
<p>You <dfn>do this</dfn>. It seems <dfn>extremely fitting</dfn> for the situation, but <dfn>twilight sparkle dragon</dfn> is <dfn>annoyed</dfn> that you have <dfn>embraced</dfn> her <dfn>cliched facade</dfn> with <dfn>real enthusiasm</dfn>. It's like you're some sort of <dfn>poseur</dfn>, <dfn>geez</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Tiny Lu: get a running start and jump.</p>
<p>You <dfn>get into the air quite easily</dfn>, and <dfn>reach the button on the ceiling</dfn>. However, you turn out to be <dfn>too tiny</dfn> to <dfn>impart the force necessary to press the button</dfn>. You <dfn>fling yourself</dfn> at it <dfn>repeatedly</dfn>, but it does not work. Your <dfn>patheticness</dfn> rises.</p>

<p class="prompt">Tiny Lu: enter green button</p>
<p>You <dfn>see no entrance</dfn> on the <dfn>green button</dfn>, unlike the ones on <dfn>yourself</dfn>, the <dfn>device</dfn>, or the <dfn>spider</dfn>. It's <dfn>too bad</dfn>, really, because that was <dfn>pretty clever</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">(Grow(Tiny Lu(Press(giant green button))))</p>
<p>The <dfn>author</dfn> is <dfn>extremely grateful</dfn> that someone remembered that <dfn>seguellogyms existed</dfn>, because he thinks they're <dfn>rather neat</dfn>.</p>

<p>Even so, <dfn>tiny Lu</dfn> can't just <dfn>grow</dfn> as an action. <dfn>seguellogysm</dfn>s don't make the impossible possible, they just <dfn>break causality into pieces</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Meta-meta-player: turn on cutscene mode.</p>
<p>Twilight stares down the Tiny Lu. "What are you doing up there, foul insect? Have at thee!"</p>
<p>She swats into the air, but Tiny Lu is too high to reach.</p>

<p class="prompt">Loki: insert a deus ex machina for the finale that fulfills conservation of detail by involving characters introduced much earlier.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a rather <dfn>rotund</dfn> and <dfn>dragonized</dfn> Miss Pinkamina appears in the doorway! She proceeds to <dfn>eat Spike</dfn>. Then, being <dfn>cold-blooded</dfn>, her <dfn>metabolism</dfn> forces her to <dfn>fall asleep</dfn> while <dfn>digesting</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Odin: return game to obsolete video rental store in disgust and write an angry fan review on the internet.</p>
<p>Odin <dfn>purchased the game</dfn> on <dfn>steam</dfn> as part of a <dfn>flash sale</dfn>. He <dfn>thoroughly regrets this</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Lu: throw tiny Lu at giant green button</p>
<p>You <dfn>wind up</dfn> and <dfn>chuck</dfn> the <dfn>tiny guided missile that is yourself</dfn> at the <dfn>button</dfn>. It <dfn>depresses</dfn> with a satisfying <dfn>chork</dfn>.</p>

<p>Wait, a <dfn>chork</dfn>?</p>

<p>Oh. Tiny Lu is <dfn>dead</dfn>. That's okay, though, I guess. You weren't <dfn>being</dfn> her at the moment, so you don't <dfn>lose</dfn> the game.</p>

<p class="prompt">undo anyway</p>

<p>Tiny <dfn>Lu</dfn> is <dfn>alive</dfn>. The <dfn>button</dfn> is no longer <dfn>splattered with blood</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">(Strength(Tiny Lu(Press(giant green button))))</p>
<p><dfn>strength</dfn> is only a <dfn>verb</dfn> in <dfn>pokemon</dfn>, pipsqueak. Not even in that.Oh you cheated :P</p>

<p class="prompt">X the darn button</p>
<p>The [darn] <dfn>giant green button</dfn> is <dfn>still depressed</dfn>. <dfn>oops</dfn>, I <dfn>guess</dfn> I <dfn>left that out of the undo description</dfn>. <dfn>what tomfoolery</dfn>!</p>

<p>Everyone is suddenly not dragons anymore. Or spiders, or blobponies, either.</p>

<p>You wonder how to get <dfn>home</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">confront twilight sparkle pony</p>
<p>You <dfn>stare down</dfn> the <dfn>alternate twilight</dfn>. She <dfn>cowers</dfn>, and makes a <dfn>pitiable face with her eyebrows raised together and her lip bitten slightly</dfn>. It is <dfn>enviously adorable</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Odin: experience A recurrence of epistaxis</p>
<p><dfn>Odin</dfn> reaffirms the ancient <dfn>anime trope</dfn>. He <dfn>overdoes it</dfn>, as he is <dfn>wont to do</dfn>, and <dfn>bleeds out</dfn>.</p>

<p><dfn>Loki resumes control</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">leave the library and walk home</p>
<p>You <dfn>go back to the alternate version of your house</dfn>. The <dfn>alternate</dfn> Miss Pinkamina <dfn>rapes you</dfn>, <dfn>to death</dfn>.</p>

<p>You never bothered to solve that part :P</p>

<p class="prompt">oops. undo that. Except maybe undo this undo to use tomfoolery to get back to your home universe.</p>
<p>You attempt to use <dfn>tomfoolery</dfn>, but you seem to have <dfn>absorbed</dfn> the shard of <dfn>pure and utter bullshit</dfn> that powered it. You'll probably need some <dfn>more</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">go back to the aforementioned shards and pick up another one.</p>
<p>You <dfn>retrieve</dfn> a <dfn>shard</dfn> and <dfn>swallow it</dfn>. It <dfn>rips your insides to shreds</dfn>. <dfn>oops</dfn>.</p>

<p>You'll probably want to get some <dfn>help</dfn>, like you had <dfn>last time</dfn>. Sadly, <dfn>tiny Lu</dfn> has somehow <dfn>reintegrated</dfn> with you, in an <dfn>annoying cutscene-forced manner</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">undo to just before tiny Lu reintegrates and then use sequence breaking to skip that particular cutscene</p>
<p>You <dfn>do so</dfn>. All of the details are <dfn>elided</dfn>. You now have a <dfn>tiny Lu</dfn>.</p>

<p>Also, <dfn>the axiomatic model of the universe falls to pieces</dfn>, but <dfn>not through regular command usage</dfn>, so you <dfn>don't get that achievement again or anything</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Learn defense from book and/or spider</p>
<p>You take the <dfn>fifty-pound spider</dfn> and <dfn>flip through its pages</dfn>. You now understand how to take the <dfn>pussy way out</dfn>, something you <dfn>never before knew</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Tiny Lu: be in your head.</p>
<p>Done.</p>

<p class="prompt">Tiny Lu: punch and stroke the walls to relieve the horrible numbness in your soul.</p>
<p>You <dfn>release your built-up patheticness</dfn> and <dfn>frustgruntlement</dfn> in a <dfn>sexy</dfn>/<dfn>nihilistic combo</dfn>. The <dfn>walls</dfn> get <dfn>stained with vagueness</dfn>, which manages to <dfn>travel through time</dfn> and <dfn>taint your previous thoughts</dfn>. You have ensured your <dfn>continued perversion</dfn> (and <dfn>existence</dfn>.)</p>

<p class="prompt comment">Stay interesting, Scootaloo. Here's looking at you, kid.</p>

<p class="prompt">Tiny Lu: examine and listen to control panel in your head.</p>
<p>You <dfn>see the panel</dfn>. It looks much the same as before, but now the <dfn>switch</dfn> has been replaced by a <dfn>giant blue button</dfn>. It sounds like <dfn>twilight whimpering</dfn> and <dfn>quivering</dfn>. Her <dfn>pathos</dfn> is at <dfn>maximum</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Tiny Lu: turn dials to get back to home universe.</p>
<p>You <dfn>go the frig home</dfn>. Or, rather, to <dfn>the library</dfn> that exists near <dfn>your home</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Meta-meta-meta-player: complain about extra-long denoument</p>
<p>You <dfn>do so</dfn>. The Meta-meta-meta-meta-player tells you to <dfn>shut up</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Lu: goals</p>

<p>3. <dfn>find out what</dfn> Miss Pinkamina <dfn>is so busy with in the playroom</dfn>, and get her to <dfn>come out</dfn> and <dfn>spend quality time</dfn> with you. (<dfn>maybe</dfn>, on a <dfn>meta level</dfn>)</p>

<p class="prompt">Loki: goals</p>
<p>1. Get <dfn>all the achievements</dfn>. (<dfn>yes</dfn>, <dfn>soon</dfn>)</p>

<p>1. (Tied for first) Scratch <dfn>itchy empty eye socket</dfn>. (<dfn>yes</dfn>, <dfn>soon</dfn>)</p>
<p>3. Get <dfn>all the MAJIKKX</dfn>. (<dfn>yes</dfn>!)</p>

<p class="prompt">player ace2401: goals</p>

<p>1. <dfn>have Lu completely destroy the axiomatic model of the universe just through regular command usage</dfn>. (<dfn>yes</dfn>)</p>

<p class="prompt">Tiny Lu: press blue button on control panel.</p>
<p>You <dfn>press the button</dfn>. Suddenly, you are <dfn>in your room</dfn>, <dfn>in your house</dfn>, <dfn>back in shackles</dfn>. Everything is <dfn>as it was many hours ago</dfn>. Except for <dfn>you</dfn>, who now knows the secrets of <dfn>MAJIKK</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">Meta^(first infinite ordinal)-player: complain about lack of sleep not fair</p>
<p>You <dfn>agree</dfn> with this <dfn>sentiment</dfn>, as you find yourself <dfn>dozing off as well</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">stab self with pointed chain</p>
<p class="prompt">absorb bullshit</p>
<p class="prompt">destroy chains with tomfoolery</p>
<p>You <dfn>suck</dfn> the <dfn>pure and utter bullshit</dfn> out of those <dfn>chains that were able to hold the most flexible pony in equestria in bed</dfn>. You use them to power a massive wave of <dfn>tomfoolery</dfn>, which <dfn>destroys</dfn> them outright, while still leaving quite a bit left over.</p>

Everything on your body, and the room around you, is <dfn>cleansed</dfn>, including the <dfn>virulent filth</dfn>. You, however, are rendered perfectly <dfn>safe</dfn> by your <dfn>terror</dfn>. Your <dfn>room</dfn> is rendered safe because it is a <dfn>room</dfn>, and in this <dfn>badly-modeled interactive fiction</dfn> you cannot <dfn>destroy</dfn> one of those.</p>

<p>You are now <dfn>clean</dfn>.</p>

<p>+500 points.</p>

<p class="prompt">Odin: While dying of exsanguination, do an about face and arrogantly mutter a complaint that the answer is now being given on a platter</p>
<p>You <dfn>do so</dfn>. <dfn>Loki</dfn> gives you a <dfn>pimpslap</dfn> because you are <dfn>interrupting his game</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">shower</p>
<p>You <dfn>enter the shower</dfn>, and <dfn>turn on the water</dfn>.</p>
<p>Oh dear, whatever will happen?</p>

<p>Miss Pinkamina <dfn>enters the bathroom</dfn> with her <dfn>game face on</dfn>. She sees your <dfn>supple foal body</dfn>, your powerful <dfn>axe-wielding arms</dfn>, your <dfn>strong smell of burnt flesh</dfn>&hellip; and she just can't help herself. She <dfn>jumps on you</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">defend</p>
<p>You <dfn>know how to deal with this sort of thing</dfn>. You <dfn>curl up into</dfn> A <dfn>ball</dfn> and <dfn>whimper</dfn> like a <dfn>demure lass</dfn> that you're <dfn>not ready</dfn> for her <dfn>affections</dfn>. Miss Pinkamina is <dfn>overcome</dfn> with your display of Möe, and slumps to the floor.</p>

<p class="prompt">ask pinkamina about what she was doing in the playroom</p>
<p>Pinkamina explains that, somehow, a <dfn>rift in time</dfn> had deposited an alternate, and therefore <dfn>eminently disposable</dfn>, <dfn>twilight sparkle pony</dfn> into the playroom. The best part? Her <dfn>pathos</dfn> was <dfn>maximum</dfn>. She wants to savor this one.</p>

<p>You have <dfn>solved the mystery</dfn>. <dfn>ten points to gryffindor</dfn>.</p>

<p class="prompt">turn off the water</p>
<p>You <dfn>turn off the water</dfn>. That is important.</p>

<p class="prompt">ask pinkamina to come to your room</p>
<p>You and Miss Pinkamina enter your room, which is quite <dfn>tidy</dfn>, on account of having <dfn>nothing in it whatsoever</dfn>. Miss Pinkamina pays this no mind.</p>

<p class="prompt">ask pinkamina what she was going to tell you before</p>
<p>You <dfn>ask</dfn>. Miss Pinkamina stifles a cough, then says that she <dfn>knows what you did last night</dfn>. You <dfn>spill the beans</dfn> [and confess to the hot <dfn>vaugeness</dfn> you had with <dfn>rainbow dash</dfn> last night] immediately, but then follow it up with the story of <dfn>all the stupid shit you did</dfn> just to hide this fact from her.</p>
<p>She flushes deeply, and gives you a <dfn>kiss</dfn>. "You did all that? All that <dfn>complex plotting</dfn> and <dfn>stupid roundabout bullshit</dfn>, just to <dfn>clean your room</dfn>?"</p>
<p>"I've&hellip;" she says, petting your hair, "I've never been so <dfn>proud</dfn>!"</p>

<p>You are now in the <dfn>dimension of incompetent buffoonery</dfn>. However, the <dfn>author</dfn> is <dfn>too tired to describe</dfn> the <dfn>events</dfn> that <dfn>transpire</dfn> once you are <dfn>there</dfn>. Suffice it to say, <dfn>rocks fall</dfn> and <dfn>nobody dies</dfn>.</p>
