      <p>I set out to write a didactic exploration on the nature of ethics in a utopia, in the <a href="http://hpmor.com/">time-tested form</a> of fanfiction. This fanfiction happened to be <a href="http://askpinkaminadianepie.tumblr.com/"><em>of</em> a fanfiction</a>, which was itself of <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qTTzMqlRTHeHIarZZhwQhADc-1aff9fkHKWx-kn0wMk/edit?hl=en&pli=1">another fanfiction</a>, which branched roughly from something otherwise nice and cheerful. At this level of indirection, the source material is unrecognizable.</p>

      <p>Interesting mostly for the character studies; the didactic part of the story was lost in the noise of fanservice. You could try to <a href="loopie/prologue/index.html">read it all from the beginning</a> if you wanted to pick it out.</p>

      <p>These are transcripts of <em>improvisational Interactive Fiction</em> sessions. I served as the "game interpreter" for a group of friends, in a manner similar to <a href="http://sleepisdeath.net/">Sleep is Death</a>. Commands were given on an Etherpad, and then my responses were edited in below each command, as if I was relaying responses from some game program only I had access to.</p>

        <dd>A non-canon extension of the LooPie universe, and a bawdy and terrible satire of the conventions of IF. Notable, I think, for using <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Monad">monads</a> as a game mechanic.</dd>
