      <h2 id="inftytale">Infinity's Tale</h2>

      <p>Infinity's Tale is a science-fiction (or space-opera) setting built upon the theories of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercomputation">hypercomputation</a> and <a href="http://www.simulation-argument.com/">universe simulation</a>. The stories I've written in it center around a game designer and his penchant for gaining control of world economies.</p>

      <h3>Early drafts</h2>

      <p>I've been working in the Infinity's Tale universe since I was eleven years old. You might enjoy reading what younger me thought was cool.</p>

        <dt><a href="../inftytale/prologue1/001.html">Prologue, attempt 1</a> (2005&mdash;2008)</dt>
        <dd>I wrote the first page of this at some point back in high-school. It all fit on one page of foolscap paper, and it was the first time I was ever genuinely happy with my writing. After that, I added onto it in fits and starts. It took me a long time to come up with a better opening than this one.</dd>

        <dt><a href="../inftytale/prologue2/001.html#title">Prologue, attempt 2</a> (2009)</dt>
        <dd>A second attempt at the first chapter of the first book. A bit too on-the-nose this time. Note the scrollbar, though.</dd>

        <dt><a href="../inftytale/joy/index.html">Joy</a> (2005)</dt>
        <dd>A combination of narrative excerpts and infodumping segments which together developed the idea of "the maintainers," the mortal gods who keep the Infinity's Tale universe operational.</dd>

      <h2 id="misc">EtherIF games</h2>
    
      <p>These are transcripts of <em>improvisational Interactive Fiction</em> sessions. I served as the "game interpreter" for a group of friends, in a manner similar to <a href="http://sleepisdeath.net/">Sleep is Death</a>. Commands were given on an Etherpad, and then my responses were edited in below each command, as if I was relaying responses from some game program only I had access to.</p>

        <dd>A girl has decided not to die. Intended to be a romance, but we never really reached that point. This story is unfinished.</dd>
