            <p>My goodness, you seem to be terribly excited about school.  Hoping to run into a certain unicorn filly?</p>

          <p>Uh&#8230;</p>
          <p><sub>&#8230;well, I didn&#8217;t. Run into her, I mean.</sub></p>
          <p>She was out sick. Apparently she&#8217;s been sick a lot so far this semester. I feel so bad that I can&#8217;t tell her to get better soon&#8230; I can&#8217;t go to her house, and she doesn&#8217;t even have a Ponynet connection&#8230; maybe I could send her a letter&#8230;?</p>
          <p>Or, Applebloom! I could send Applebloom! Right, I should get back to, uh, today. I saw Applebloom! She&#8217;s in my class this year! She caught me up, at lunchtime, on everything she and Sweetie Belle did since I last saw them. Oh, middle school is weird; lunch is only like 45 minutes now&#8230; but yeah! Applebloom!</p>
          <p>Hmm&#8230; maybe I should go back a bit. I feel like I&#8217;m forgetting something&#8230;</p>
          <p>Oh. Right.</p>
          <p>This is going to sound weird: Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon—<a href='../fluttershy-is-alive/#post-95'>you remember them, right?</a>—they&#8217;re, uh&#8230; <strong>alive.</strong> I watched the blood drain out of their bodies myself, and there they were, walking into the classroom as attendance was being called. Not a scratch on them. I don&#8217;t know what happened there; maybe more stuff is different now. I should probably go check that Fluttershy is actually <em>alive,</em> come to think of it. Even though I remember walking her home, I&#8217;m not&#8230; <em>sure,</em> now. This is all starting to get confusing.</p>
          <p>Oh, and Cheerilee is back from Manehattan, I guess. She had her hair done up weird, like in a picture she showed us of herself once. And she introduced herself like none of us had ever met her before (&#8230;though I guess that makes sense; there&#8217;s new foals in each class every year.) She was acting a bit&#8230; I can&#8217;t really describe it. Mean, I guess. We just sat there and stared at her, and then she seemed to, uh, relax a little.</p>
          <p>Anyway.</p>
          <p>Since it was already a week into school, I have <em>so much homework</em> right now. I should probably go do it. &#8230;maybe. After I answer a few questions. Just a few.</p>

            <p>So, does Miss Pinkamina ever come out of her house, other than to retrieve victims? She would need to get supplies/food(Well, she has plenty of food when shes done with her victims I imagine). Does she let you do all of this?</p>

          <p>She doesn&#8217;t even come out for that. I typed some stuff about the way she acts into the Ponynet, and it said she was &#8220;agoraphobic.&#8221; I really want to get her out of the house; maybe I can show her it&#8217;s not so bad&#8230; take her out on a hike somewhere, some quiet place where there aren&#8217;t so many ponies&#8230; <sub><em>*sigh*</em></sub></p>
          <p>I do all of our shopping, take out the garbage, get the mail&#8230; and catch all our victims. She used to come out with me, to show me how to do that part, but now that she&#8217;s sure I can do it myself she just stays home. I&#8217;m happy that she trusts me to do it, but&#8230; it was more fun when she was right there beside me.</p>

            <p>If Miss Pinkamena doesn&#039;t leave her house, how does she get her various drugs and such?  Does she send you into the Everfree Forest to collect herbs?</p>
          </blockquote>
        </div>
        <div class='post-answer post-content'>
          <p>Yeah, sometimes&#8230; but really, there&#8217;s nothing very useful in the Everfree forest, beyond one or two weird plants nopony but her knows the properties of. Mostly, she just orders chemicals and equipment <a href="http://www.gfschemicals.com/statics/index.html">online</a>, then mixes them up herself (this is what most of the living room is dedicated to.) She&#8217;s been doing it so long as part of her job that nopony&#8217;s ever questioned the things that get mailed here.</p>
          <p>Some of the more basic/physical-process stuff, though, like liquid nitrogen, don&#8217;t survive transit that well, so we have to make them ourselves. Miss Pinkamina paid Twilight a long time ago to make her a few, er, <em>sympathy</em> artifacts, like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's_demon">heat exchange plate</a>; she likes being self-sufficient for that kind of stuff. (While she&#8217;s working, she tends to grumble about how unicorns take everything for granted. I bet she&#8217;d grumble just as much about how flaky biologically-powered magic is if she had a horn of her own, though.)</p>

            <p>So you&#039;ve tasted ponies done in many different methods of cooking. Do you have a personal favorite? Also, did it at all bother you, even a tiny bit, when Miss Pinkamena admitted her preference for smoked Pegasus wings?</p>

          <p>No; I think pegasus wings taste pretty awesome too! Pegasi have a different physiology from earth ponies or unicorns; we&#8217;re, mostly, uh&#8230; &#8220;white meat.&#8221; (Yes, like a <em>chicken</em>. Shut up.) Miss Pinkamina&#8217;s system is balanced between the races of ponies, because they&#8217;re all pretty much equally fun to torture—but in our freezer, pegasus meat always takes priority.</p>
          <p>I think my favorite meal we ever did was honey-soy pegasus kebabs, on the barbecue in the backyard. I did all the chopping up and spearing; miss Pinkamina did the barbecuing. <sub>She said later, that it had almost felt like a party&#8230;</sub></p>

            <p>Hiya Scootaloo. Now that you&#039;re at school, does anypony ever ask about where you live, or what it&#039;s like living with Miss Pinkamina?

        <div class='post-answer post-content'>
          <p>Oh. That happened today. That&#8217;s what I was forgetting.</p>
          <p>So, miss Cheerilee was all like, &#8220;I&#8217;m Ponizuka <em>Cheer-</em>illy, twenty-two. Nice to meetcha.&#8221; And then she took attendance. It was like this:</p>
          <blockquote>
          <p><strong>&#8220;Paradise.&#8221;</strong></p>
          <p>&#8220;Present~&#8221;</p>

          <p><strong>&#8220;Pie… Scootaloo.&#8221;</strong></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>And then everypony looked at me. I still felt a little warm inside for a moment, &#8216;cause miss Pinkamina had gone to the trouble of asking them to change it—but none of those ponies looked happy about it. They all looked kind of …expectant, like I was going to pull off my mask and reveal that I was the Tirek or something. Nonetheless:</p>
          <blockquote>
          <p>&#8220;H-here! …I-&#8220;</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>And then miss Cheerilee went on to the next filly, and I forgot about it. Until the start of lunch, when this pony I didn&#8217;t know came over to talk to me.</p>
          <blockquote>
          <p>&#8220;Hi—Scootaloo? Can I, uh… can I talk to you a sec?&#8221;</p>
          <p>&#8220;Sure?&#8221;</p>
          <p>&#8220;I …I just wanted to tell you, I know. I know all about it.&#8221;</p>
          <p>&#8220;I… <sub>oh no…</sub>&#8221;</p>
          <p>&#8220;No! No, don&#8217;t… don&#8217;t be scared. I meant, I… <sub>I&#8217;m bad at this…</sub> I wanted to tell you that I know what you&#8217;re going through, getting your mom taken away and all.&#8221;</p>
          <p>&#8220;…<em>what-</em>&#8221;</p>
          <p>&#8220;-cause I, my mom, I kind of <sub>lost her too</sub>, um. I… I&#8217;m sorry. I&#8217;m Ruby Pinch. Can… can we be friends?&#8221;</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>So yeah. That happened. I&#8217;m not really sure what to do, Tumblr. I asked miss Pinkamina; she said I should just do whatever feels better. It would feel better to not have to lie to her…</p>
          <p>But, oh, to answer the rest of your question, I told Applebloom a few things, after she gave me all her news. She <em>does</em> understand, I think. I haven&#8217;t told her the, um, hard stuff—just stuff about miss Pinkamina, and how she&#8217;s better than Rainbow Dash, and would never do those kinds of things, and… yeah.</p>
          <p>And I did apologize to her. She said not to worry about it—but then she hugged me, really tightly. Silly filly.</p>

          <p>Guns? Sort of baroque now, aren&#8217;t they? I mean, I guess they might be <em>okay</em> if you&#8217;re an earth-pony, need to defend yourself, but don&#8217;t know any unicorns that could Shape a good staff for you&#8230;</p>

More friends can&#8217;t be a bad thing can it? Secondly, I saw someone mentioned what Rainbow Dash did, and that you really don&#8217;t want to talk about it, ((<strong>Forced OOC:</strong> but I noticed that she immediately deeply regretted what she did to you, and wished she had tried to comfort you, or apologize for something that I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ve told us about.))
          <p>There&#8217;s a lot of things you haven&#8217;t told us about your relationship with Rainbow Dash, and I respect that you don&#8217;t want to talk about it, but whatever happened, I think she really does care for you, even if she doesn&#8217;t have a history of showing it very well. Maybe in the future, even the distant future, you should resolve whatever happened between the two of you. If only for some closure, if that&#8217;s what it comes to.</p>

          <p>I do want to be Ruby&#8217;s friend. She seems nice. It just seems like it would be&#8230; hard. Hard to base a relationship with somepony on such a big lie like that. &#8220;Hi, I killed your mom; want to be friends?&#8221; &#8230;I don&#8217;t know. Miss Pinkamina said that &#8220;lying is just something society discourages to make sure everypony is playing the game; and that [I] should ignore the negative feeling when [I] lie, and just think about the real consequences&#8230;&#8221;</p>
          <p>I&#8217;m sure Rainbow Dash cares. She wouldn&#8217;t have&#8230; have hit me, if she didn&#8217;t care in the first place. But I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s a way to talk to her, without just making her angry again. I&#8217;d need some sort of miracle to fix things at this point&#8230;</p>

            <p>Thanks for answering me! This blog is one in my top three among all pony blogs so it was really an honor, Scootaloo. (Never did understand that chicken joke...)

          <p>Hmm&#8230; this is hard to explain, precisely. For miss Pinkamina, a &#8220;party&#8221; isn&#8217;t about making ponies happy. A party is a big plan that goes off without a hitch. The bigger the production, and the <em>less</em> likely it is for everything to be just so—the happier it makes her when it is. She feels some of the same happiness from cooking, doing complex torture, setting up weird bondage scenes, making pony-clothing and &#8220;art&#8221;&#8230; but none of it is exactly the same.</p>
          <p>That barbecue, she planned four months in advance. She decided what meat we would use, then went through the correct number of victims in that amount of time so that we would have fresh pegasus meat on the day of. She planted the vegetables in the garden at exactly the right times so they would ripen that day. And, I think, somehow, she knew I would be there, even before I moved in&#8230; the portions turned out to be exactly enough for the two of us together. She was so happy when the weather was nice that day; she just spun around in the yard, skipping and laughing and looking up at the sky.</p>
          <p>It does make me a little sad, because it takes all that work to make her truly happy&#8230; I&#8217;ve never been able to put that sort of smile on her face myself. But it&#8217;s okay; I&#8217;ll keep trying. I have a feeling that somehow, making her smile will get me my cutie mark one day~</p>

        <div class='post-answer post-content'>
          <p>Well, &#8220;normal&#8221; is …not <em>quite</em> the word. I&#8217;ve only known her for about a year, so I don&#8217;t know if I can really say what she&#8217;s like &#8220;deep down,&#8221; but she seemed like she was really—whole, I guess? Before. All one solid arrow of energy and drive, pursuing whatever she was doing with complete focus and attention. You couldn&#8217;t distract her. Now she&#8217;s… well, I guess she&#8217;s become more like me. Unsure about things… and sometimes she&#8217;ll just give ponies this <em>dry</em> look, that I don&#8217;t know the meaning of. I think she might have picked it up from Applejack. It seems to scare the colts in our class.</p>
          <p>So, anyway, I guess I&#8217;ll make this post my school update for the day. We rearranged our sitting order in the morning. Apparently we&#8217;re gonna do that every week; it&#8217;s supposed to make us make more friends instead of being &#8220;cliquey.&#8221; And, well, now Ruby Pinch is sitting beside me.</p>
          <p>So… I talked to her. It wasn&#8217;t that hard; mostly I just listened. I don&#8217;t think the filly has that many friends, herself. She told me some stories about her mom, about the fun things they would do together; also some bad stuff, but she was still smiling even while she talked about that. I guess everypony&#8217;s parents have their problems…</p>
          <p>But then she told me about some other things. Other things I happened to already know, for very different reasons. See, there&#8217;s this colt she liked in her class last year—he was her best friend. I guess maybe her only friend. And he&#8217;s kind of, um. He&#8217;s <sub>broken</sub> now.</p>
          <p>She was talking about Ms. Doo&#8217;s son. The one miss Pinkamina thought we should kill to, to <em>help</em> her. Because taking care of him after his accident was, &#8220;logically,&#8221; just making her more depressed and unstable. It would be an act of mercy for her, she said.</p>
          <p>We already had him here and tied up before she broke down and stormed out of the room, shouting to take him back.</p>
          <p>&#8230;I said hi to Archer at lunch, and thanked her for sending me that message. She&#8217;s still not in my class this year, though. <sub>…oh, I hope she didn&#8217;t read much of my Tumblr. That didn&#8217;t occur to me until just now. Um. Maybe I&#8217;ll ask her tomorrow…</sub></p>
          <p>Sweetie Belle&#8217;s still sick. Applebloom says she&#8217;s okay, and that Ms. Rarity is just being picky, not wanting to release her Belle until she&#8217;s able to be perfect for us all again. I said that that&#8217;s dumb and that that&#8217;s not how Ms. Rarity thinks; she&#8217;s probably keeping her home because Sweetie Belle <em>wants</em> to be <em>here,</em> to punish her for some silly unavoidable thing she did while she was sick. But then again, I doubt Ms. Rarity would really <em>want</em> to trap herself in the house with an annoyed Sweetie Belle… It would be like the world&#8217;s greatest whine-off if they both really got going, <sub>hehe.</sub> Eh, maybe she really is just sick.</p>
          <p>And…</p>
          <p>Aw, <em>dummeshuhn.</em> Cheerilee told us she would be coming around to all the kids&#8217; houses to talk to their parents, just to &#8220;get to know them.&#8221; I forgot about that. I&#8217;ve got to warn– <em>tell</em> miss Pinkamina. We probably need to clean. I… I don&#8217;t even know when she&#8217;s coming!</p>

          <p>Unicorns and earth-ponies are the same thing. The unicorn horn is an&#8230; uh, <sub>(darn it, if miss Pinkamina knew about my blog, I&#8217;d just ask her to answer you herself, she can spiel off this stuff perfectly…)</sub> an epi-gen-etic growth feature, triggered through… RNA? expression, by changes in the foetal environment.</p>
          <p>Okay; I <em>won&#8217;t</em> try to explain the science, I think. Anyway, the point is that nopony starts with a horn; they grow one while developing when there&#8217;s a certain level of magic &#8220;flux&#8221; in the womb. This can be caused by living in a very magical place, or by having a mother who uses—or is exposed to—magic a lot. Most unicorns have unicorn children without putting in any extra effort, just because they use so much magic all the time. Some that don&#8217;t, start to put in a conscious effort to use magic more once they get pregnant, to make sure they get a unicorn; and some don&#8217;t worry about it and end up with earth-pony foals sometimes. Actually, some <em>earth-ponies</em> get regular &#8220;enchantments&#8221; in order to give birth to unicorn foals. <sub>And some pegasi do the same thing, because they think it honours the gods to have an alicorn… I don&#8217;t want to talk about them.</sub></p>
          <p>Now, how much innate magical potential a pony has, <em>that&#8217;s</em> genetic—and I guess you can get confused, because if a pony has a lot of innate magical power, then nine times out of ten they&#8217;ll grow a horn—whether their parents have one or not—because of all the magical flux they&#8217;re creating <em>themselves</em> while growing. (There&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rh_disease">this disease</a> a foal can get from that, though, if they&#8217;re a second child or later; it sounded really bad when miss Pinkamina described it…)</p>
          <p>Anyway, all of that is to say, unicorns and earth-ponies will taste <em>almost</em> exactly the same. The one difference is that unicorns get to shunt all their magical potential out through their horn, so their blood just tastes like animal blood; but earth-ponies just have their magical potential flowing through their bloodstream, so their blood tastes… well, sometimes, if they don&#8217;t <em>have</em> that much potential, it just tastes the same, but other times… I can&#8217;t quite describe it.</p>
          <p>I once drank a whole cup of it, then just sort of layed on the floor staring up at the ceiling. I don&#8217;t know how long I did that. I saw&#8230; stuff. I think I accidentally knocked a picture frame off the wall without moving. Miss Pinkamina laughed when she saw me.</p>
          <p>Oh, and the horn itself is just bone. The marrow of it gets saturated with magic, though. Miss Pinkamina saves it; she says one day she&#8217;s going to use it all to make <a href="http://earthbound.wikia.com/wiki/Magic_Cake">a cake.</a></p>

          <p>Yeah, sort of&#8230; for strictly selfish reasons, though.</p>
          <p>What we&#8217;re doing is kind of dangerous. Everything we do has a chance (however small) of killing either—or both—of us. It was exciting at first (okay, it&#8217;s still exciting, who am I kidding), but the more I care about miss Pinkamina, the more I &#8230;don&#8217;t want anything to happen to her&#8230; and, I guess, it&#8217;d be easier to make sure nothing happened if we weren&#8217;t always doing such dangerous things&#8230;</p>
          <p>But maybe it&#8217;s really the excitement of it I enjoy? Maybe, without the murdering and torturing and stuff, miss Pinkamina would just be a lame nerdy chemist pony? &#8230;I worry about that sometimes. That I&#8230; <sub>that I don&#8217;t <em>really</em> care about her, like I think I do.</sub> And it&#8217;s <strong>her</strong> who says most of the stuff to make me think that! She&#8217;s always going on about how ponies are really just doing things to signal statuses to one-another&#8230; it makes me think like I&#8217;m just some sort of robot, doing whatever my body tells me to do to, uh, <sub>get the pretty pink pony in bed with me&#8230; ehe.</sub></p>
          <p>But, you know, it <em>was</em> a relief when she took my friends off the list. I may not really care what happens to the average pony, but <em>some</em> ponies… I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;m not supposed to have to solve this sort of problem myself, right? There are famous stallions with funny beards who have debated these sorts of things for centuries; why can&#8217;t <em>they</em> tell me what I&#8217;m supposed to care about?</p>

          <p>I find it funny that nopony ever asks me these kinds of questions. All they ever talk to me about is sex and violence. Maybe they&#8217;re starved for it or something.</p>
          <p>I like platformer games. The old kind that they don&#8217;t really make much any more. It feels good to just be able to&#8230; speed around, however you like, bouncing off stuff and flinging yourself around and&#8230; you know. Same thing I try to do on my scooter, but way less clumsily. It&#8217;d be so cool if the real world had coins and stuff in it up in midair, you know? You&#8217;d get a reward whenever you did a really awesome trick or something&#8230;</p>
          <p>I don&#8217;t really have a specific preference in movies&#8230; hmm.</p>
          <ul><li>Horror movies are sort of meh now that I&#8217;m, er, <sub><em>living</em> in one, haha.</sub></li>
          <li>I don&#8217;t like romances. They&#8217;re so corny, and all the mares in them never <em>do</em> anything! They just&#8230; wait around, for some perfect stallion who carries the whole movie. </li>
          <li>Comedies are okay. I personally like them. But miss Pinkamina, well, she always has this intense look on her face when she watches one, like she&#8217;s trying to <em>learn </em>it or something. She says she enjoys them, but she doesn&#8217;t actually <em>laugh</em>&#8230;</li>
          <li>Action movies we both like. Ones with cars and explosions and stuff, I think, um, make her&#8230; well, she sometimes pauses the movie to run up to the playroom, and never comes back down to finish watching. I figured out that if I get her to put one on <em>right before bed</em>, though, when she&#8217;s too tired to do much, she&#8217;ll watch the whole thing, and then, uh&#8230; <sub>she does the most amazing stuff in her sleep. Not to me, just to&#8230; herself&#8230; um.*</sub></li>
          </ul><p>Totally lost my train of thought now, sorry.</p>

          <p>I told Tumblr about this already; she has those dreams <a href='../prologue/#post-51'>all the time</a>. That&#8217;s the closest she gets to &#8220;reverting&#8221; to Pinkie Pie.</p>
          <p>I wasn&#8217;t really sure until now whether she <em>remembered</em> much of it, though; she never wanted to talk about it after she woke up.

          <p>But I guess… I guess it&#8217;s good that she did finally let it out.

          <p>What would I do? I&#8217;d&#8230; be happy for her, I guess. <em>Really</em> happy. She&#8217;d be a whole pony again.</p>
          <p>Of course, it would have to be <em>real</em> forgiveness, not just&#8230; forgetting. You know what I mean.</p>
          <p>And Fluttershy… yeah, maybe. It&#8217;d be nice if miss Pinkamina had at least one of her old friends tell her… tell her that they accepted her, good and bad, like I do. I don&#8217;t think Fluttershy would be the one to do something like that on her own, though, which kind of screws up that plan. Maybe <em>I</em> should…?</p>
          <p>I still don&#8217;t like her being around here, though. Maybe I shouldn&#8217;t.</p>

          <p>I don&#8217;t know&#8230; she just does. I imagine she has to enjoy <em>some</em> part of it, whether she thinks she&#8217;s helping miss Pinkamina&#8230; let off steam, or whether she thinks she&#8217;ll eventually just &#8220;show her the light&#8221; somehow.

          <p>I&#8230; I can <em>talk</em> to her, maybe, but I don&#8217;t really want miss Pinkamina to, to play with her again.

            <p>Well since everyone seems set on asking about Fluttershy, I figured I&#039;d talk about something else.  Do you play any musical instruments?  Do you have a favorite kind of music?  Does Miss Pinkamina even allow you to listen to music?</p>

          <p>I figured I&#8217;d have a conversation about her for a change; I&#8217;d put it off long enough. There are a bunch of messages just sitting in my inbox from a while ago about her&#8230; and a bunch of other things I don&#8217;t like thinking about much, too.</p>
          <p>But okay, sure. I don&#8217;t play anything, yet. I mean, there are tons of instruments just laying around the house, so I tinker with them&#8230; but I don&#8217;t know where to start, really.</p>
          <p>Miss Pinkamina, on the other hand, plays everything. <em>Really well.</em> She can pick up a trombone or a violin or a keyboard and just play whatever tune she&#8217;s thinking about. Only ever a few bars, though; I&#8217;ve never heard a full song from her. I don&#8217;t even&#8230; understand, how she managed to learn all of those. Maybe she had a lot of time on her hands, growing up?</p>
          <p>But I think I could get her to teach me at least one or two instruments. Guitar seems like an obvious place to start; it would let me play my own favorite songs! <sub>(Though, talking about what kind of music I like makes me really embarrassed&#8230; so let&#8217;s just say I like rock and metal and stuff, okay?)</sub></p>
          <p>And I can listen to music any time I want in my room, but miss Pinkamina gets to decide what to play on the big sound system thing in the living room&#8230; which totally overpowers whatever I&#8217;m listening to. So I mostly use headphones, like I always have. I sleep with them on. (Mostly because I&#8217;m just used to it—but also it helps me sleep when one of our victims decides to make a lot of noise during the night.)</p>

          <p>Scooterin&#8217;, obvs. I watch Ponynet videos of tricks and stunts other ponies do, then try to do them myself. Most of the ground-based tricks I&#8217;ve got down now, but it&#8217;s pretty hard to learn the flying ones; every time I screw up and hit a tree-branch or something, I have to hike all the way back up to the top of the bluffs to start again (whereas most pegasi can just jump right back into the air&#8230;)</p>
          <p>I sometimes race other foals to places. <a href="http://mlp.wikia.com/index.php?title=List_of_ponies&amp;image=Hot_Rod-png">Hot Rod</a> (she&#8217;s in my class this year) is pretty good with her skates; I&#8217;m always saying &#8220;ha, I beat you, scooters are better!&#8221; and she&#8217;s always like &#8220;rematch and I&#8217;ll show you how much better skates are,&#8221; that sort of thing. Her friends are kind of mean, though, and she&#8217;s never that far away from them, so I tend to avoid her when I&#8217;m not really looking to beat her filly-butt. (Okay, maybe I don&#8217;t <em>always</em> win against her&#8230; but a filly is allowed her pride, right?)</p>
          <p>&#8216;sides that, I guess lately playing video games and stuff. I used to spend most days out with Sweetie Belle and Applebloom&#8230; you know, it&#8217;s harder than I thought hanging out with Applebloom when Sweetie Belle isn&#8217;t around. We argue all the time. I almost wanted to, to just jump on her and tackle her to the ground today, she was annoying me so much&#8230; but I don&#8217;t know. She&#8217;s not that bad. Maybe I got antisocial sitting around here all day.</p>
          <p>&#8230;and I <em>told</em> you, I feel embarrassed talking ab&#8230; <sub>eh, you&#8217;re all just going to keep asking until I tell you.</sub></p>
          <p>I like a lot of old hard-rock stuff from the 70&#8217;s&#8230; basically, uh, the stuff <em>Rainbow Dash</em> listens to. She introduced me to a lot of bands. You know, she really loves music; not just in the &#8220;this is so awesome, listen to it OR DIE&#8221; way she presents herself, but when she puts an album on (and they really are albums—she has all these big old sleeves with vinyl records in them; they&#8217;re not even dusty), she just sits down and stops everything in order to listen. Makes me stop talking, too.</p>
          <p>Er. Made.</p>
          <p>But besides that stuff, Sweetie Belle pushes all this weird music on me whenever she gets the chance. She steals my MP3 player sometimes (okay, it&#8217;s <em>her</em> MP3 player that she gave <em>to</em> me, but&#8230;) and gives it back full of songs from bands I&#8217;ve never heard of. They&#8217;re pretty good, though, sometimes. And she listens to everything. Classical, trance, country, little indie bands that haven&#8217;t even made a CD yet (you know, I didn&#8217;t know Ponyville <em>had</em> a music scene until she dragged me to this weird little middle-of-nowhere place one night&#8230; we had to sit and listen from outside together, because apparently they were serving alcohol inside, but it was still pretty cool.)</p>
          <p>And then there&#8217;s what miss Pinkamina listens to&#8230; um, <em>glitchcore</em> and <em>ska</em>. It&#8217;s <em>okay</em>.</p>

          <p>Yup. I have a fan, who&#8217;s not even on Tumblr. She&#8217;s… she&#8217;s really <em>into</em> it, too. At lunch, she found me again, and showed me these pictures she drew, all blood and gore and viscera everywhere; she&#8217;s completely obsessed with it… I mean, miss Pinkamina enjoys torturing, but… I can&#8217;t explain the difference. Like, a release, versus a purpose? Miss Pinkamina finishes with a victim, and then she goes back to doing <em>other</em> stuff, until she gets an <em>urge</em> to do it again. I think Archer is… well, I think I know what her cutie mark means now. Ponies don&#8217;t normally get <em>weapons</em> on their flanks.</p>
          <p>Uh, other than <em>that</em>&#8230; I hung out with Applebloom, and we got into a big argument, like I said. I don&#8217;t want to talk about it, because it&#8217;ll just make me annoyed again; better for both of us to just forget about it, I think.</p>
          <p>And, <em>in</em> class&#8230; uh, Cheerilee. The teacher. She&#8217;s <em>not</em> Cheerilee. Or, she&#8217;s at least&#8230; <em>way</em> different than the one who left last year. Before, she was soft, and kind, and nice; like, she was a <em>professional</em> at being nice to foals. Now, she&#8217;s&#8230; I don&#8217;t want to call her <em>dumb</em>, but she seems like she just started teaching.</p>
          <p>But now she&#8217;s so much more <em>into</em> it. It&#8217;s like she&#8217;s a foal herself. She bounces around the classroom reading the textbook, doing <em>voices</em>; she took us outside and just played <em>tag</em> with us, not even as part of a lesson or anything&#8230; I don&#8217;t get it. She <em>looks</em> like an adult&#8230; <em>mostly</em>&#8230; I dunno. Other than maybe miss Pinkamina, I don&#8217;t think I really understand adults&#8230;</p>

          <p>I think it was Sky who sent me the original Tumblr message to tell me to get my butt back to school—which I wanted to thank her for—but it turns out that the Archer at my school wasn&#8217;t her. But the Archer at my school <em>did</em> send me a Tumblr message, that I <em>didn&#8217;t</em> get. I&#8230; I don&#8217;t understand how that works; I guess in most universes things happen almost the same?</p>

          <p>Oh, I guess I did&#8230; I think I&#8217;m just, um, getting used to talking to her now. Nothing special came up, we just hung out.</p>
          <p>Or, actually&#8230; she <em>did</em> invite me to come over to her place for dinner on the weekend. Me <em>and</em> Applebloom, and Sweetie Belle if she&#8217;s better by then. (I don&#8217;t think she&#8217;s ever even met her before. She&#8217;s really trusting.)</p>
          <p>It&#8217;s going to be a big party—a <em>wake,</em> I think she called it. She&#8217;s not living at her house right now, since there&#8217;s nopony there to take care of her; she&#8217;s just going to be there for the night to have a big dinner that uses up all the food left in the house, and apparently then everypony is going to help her pack stuff up, and, um, talk about Berry Punch.</p>
          <p>Right now, she&#8217;s staying with the Apples, because they&#8217;re her next-door neighbours&#8230; and <em>they&#8217;re</em> going to be there, running things&#8230; but if I stick by Applebloom, they won&#8217;t be able to do anything, so&#8230; I actually <em>do</em> want to go. Just trying to work out an excuse for myself, I guess.</p>
          <p>And it&#8217;s okay&#8230; I like being watched-out for. I wish more ponies would do that, rather than just leaving me to struggle through things&#8230; (And you can&#8217;t really pry over the Ponynet; I can just ignore stupid messages, right?)</p>

          <p><strong>Interlude: Mother Nature&#8217;s Son (is what the bird be singin&#8217;)</strong></p>
          <p>Twilight Sparkle hesitated at the small, worn-stone footbridge. It had been a week of subjective time since the occurrence of the… phenomenon. She had resumed her life with reasonable speed and efficiency; the gnawing, swirling blur of images and feelings pushed back to a mere trace among the more immediate demands of her life in Ponyville. But now…</p>
          <p><!-- more -->Arriving at the front stoop, Twilight lifted her hoof to knock on the door, then saw that its upper half was free and hanging slightly ajar. The warm autumn air breezed through from inside, knocking and playing with the rusty iron lockbolt hanging from its corner. In the red dusk light, the fading and chipped purple paint, once prim on its surface, seemed to glow; it was as if it was, in its old age, swollen with pride, confidence, love for its surroundings—to be not just a door, but a living, breathing part of a home. The door belonged there, set into the house on the hill, as much as the grass or the stream or the sky.</p>
          <p>Twilight reached around and pulled the two halves of the door open, and stepped inside the cottage. The air was warm, smelling of wood chips and hay, aromatic herbs and faint dried flowers. A quiet, indiscernable noise drifted in from the far room. She called out, &#8220;are you… <sub>are you home?&#8221;</sub></p>
          <p>The unicorn stilled, listening for a response, then walked on, both her steps and her breathing slow and measured. There was a photo album laying splayed-open on the diminutive dining room table, covering a half-folded newspaper and set next to an empty bowl. The kitchen was tidy, but for a few remnant carrot peelings stuck to the dry walls of the sink. Nothing moved but the wind.</p>
          <p>Twilight stood in the kitchen for a good while.</p>
          <p>The sound, finding its way in through the empty window-slats of the back door, brought her back to attention. It was a hum, perhaps a birdsong, an evening sparrow at the edge of the forest crooning to find its distant lover. Twilight cautiously, perhaps now reverently, followed it out.</p>
          <p>The small picket-garden behind the house was sprawled lazily along the backside of the hill, looking to be in imperceptible motion; the shaded trees of the forest beyond could have watched it run, like sweet molasses, down the hillside as they grew. It was cooler in the shade, and Twilight&#8217;s arms and neck felt the chill of evening setting upon them. The sun was still hanging, wide and low, before the horizon, not quite willing to return home from its day&#8217;s journey. Mosquitoes and dragonflies flitted about low to the ground, resting in the setting dew of the grass. And the hum, from far above…</p>
          <p>Twilight felt her face grow hot, then wet.</p>
          <p>The pegasus saw her, and flew down to land gently beside the unicorn, who had now also buckled to her knees on the ground.</p>
          <p>&#8220;Oh! <sub>Twilight, are you <em>okay?</em> You look so very sad about something. Did… did something happen to somepony?&#8221;</sub></p>
          <p>Twilight couldn&#8217;t answer. Fluttershy went with her instincts, and knelt down, wrapping her wing around the shivering pony. <sub>&#8220;Shhh. Shhh. It&#8217;s alright. I&#8217;m here. Don&#8217;t worry.&#8221;</sub></p>
          <hr><p><br/><br/>&#8220;…and that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m here, Fluttershy. Do you think you&#8217;ll be going?&#8221;</p>
          <p><sub>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t think I should intrude. Death is the most <em>personal</em> of personal things, and only the family should…&#8221;</sub></p>
          <p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s not just about Berry, you know; <em>I</em> need to go to oversee the legal division of the Punch estate, under the acting title of lady dutchess of Ponyville. Everypony is welcome if they think they have a clai–&#8221;</p>
          <p>&#8220;<strong>No.</strong> <sub>Uh, I mean… I don&#8217;t think it would be very <em>respectful</em> of me, even then. I never even knew miss Punch. You can give my best to little Ruby, though; and you can come tell me <em>all</em> about how it went tomorrow, if that will make you feel better. Does that sound alright, Twilight?&#8221;</sub></p>
          <p>&#8220;I… I think I will. Come and visit you later, I mean.</p>
          <p>&#8230;</p>
          <p><sub>I&#8217;m so happy that you&#8217;re here, Fluttershy.&#8221;</sub></p>
          <p>The serene expression on the face of the yellow pegasus was mixed with only the slightest glimmer of bemusement.</p>
          <p><sub>&#8220;Where else could I be?&#8221;</sub></p>

          <p>Yeah; I read lots of stuff. I mean, I always have, since there isn&#8217;t much to do at night when you&#8217;re, uh, <em>camping</em> by yourself&#8230;</p>
          <p>But now it&#8217;s mostly because miss Pinkamina keeps a really weird schedule, and I like being on it (though I can&#8217;t as much now that I also have to be up for school&#8230;) so, even though I&#8217;m not tired and feel like going out and doing stuff, it&#8217;s kinda the middle of the night and wouldn&#8217;t really work too well. So I stay in, and do, uh, indoor stuff: play games, read books, watch TV&#8230; I don&#8217;t think any of it&#8217;s going to get me my cutie mark, but it&#8217;s at least giving me a bunch of inspiration for cool stuff to try!</p>
          <p>I mostly read adventure and fantasy books; spy-thrillers and made-up travelogues to other planets and stuff like that. I don&#8217;t really get &#8220;literature&#8221;; it&#8217;s just ponies talking and arguing about stuff for hundreds of pages. And I don&#8217;t read romance.

          <p>Ms. Rarity collects magazines; I look at those sometimes when I&#8217;m over there. They&#8217;re mostly filled with pictures of ponies who look, uh—kind of like me, weirdly enough, covered in frilly clothing. I guess that&#8217;s &#8220;fashion?&#8221;</p>

          <p>Yeah, stuff like that. I make myself breakfast; miss Pinkamina usually isn&#8217;t up yet when I get up. I try not to make too much of a mess by cooking eggs or bacon or anything; besides the fact that I tend to burn things like that, miss Pinkamina always insists I leave it all for her to clean up after. I don&#8217;t want to make extra work for her on top of all the stuff she already does&#8230;</p>
          <p>When miss Pinkamina <em>is</em> up in the morning, she makes tasty (and noticeably sweet) things like cinnamon french toast or waffles with strawberries and whip-cream. One time I was already up and in the kitchen, eating oatmeal (without sugar or anything special)—and she came in and looked at me like I was crazy, then poured herself a literal coffee-mug-full of maple syrup. (I think she just did it in a fit of sleepy pique more than anything; she was coughing and swallowing like a dog who had eaten peanut butter for the rest of the day, though she did seem pretty happy about it.)</p>

She uses it exactly where it makes for a better meal, just like everypony else. For the pegasus wings, I helped her mix up the sauce; I think it had ground pepper, garlic, cinnamon, molasses, and some herbs&#8230; there was a little Marechestershire sauce in there, but it didn&#8217;t overpower it.</p>
          <p>However, miss Pinkamina, being a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavorist">flavorist</a>, <em>does</em> sometimes put weird kinds of food together (systematically, while taking notes) just to sample the results.

          <p>I am now a biology textbook. Yay. (Well, at least it&#8217;s interesting stuff, and not, like, the cellular lifecycle of wheat germ.)</p>
          <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalidomide">The drug</a> actually permanently lowers the magical potential of babies who receive it while developing, usually down to near-zero. For earth-ponies—and also potential unicorns, who just end up as earth-ponies after exposure—this isn&#8217;t very much of a problem, though it does make them much more susceptible to certain diseases (just like a unicorn is whenever they overuse their magic) and sometimes results in a discoloration of their coat and mane—though not their eyes.</p>
          <p>For pegasi&#8230; well, they can&#8217;t fly very well afterward. Pegasi use up most of their magical potential in their wings to beat the <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquareCubeLaw">square/cube law</a>. Without it, they have, uh, wings that don&#8217;t do much. They can still walk on clouds just as easily—that&#8217;s just a part of their physical make-up, it doesn&#8217;t cost energy—but they can&#8217;t really <em>get around</em> up in the air (since Cloudsdale, and other cloudfall cities, are built in a mostly-vertical structure which is pretty much inaccessible to non-flying creatures), so they have to come and live down here.</p>
          <p>Because of that, and I think still a little bit because of what happened 60 years ago, pegasi who live on the ground are kind of looked down upon by both earth-ponies and other pegasi. It&#8230; it really sucks, you know?</p>

(Still, that&#8217;s why you don&#8217;t see her at all some days—she&#8217;s laying in bed with a tummy-ache after eating <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002589">fusion tacos</a> or something.)</p>

          <p>Yeah, that sums it up. They&#8217;re afraid, and alone. People who are afraid <em>together</em> form mobs, but we don&#8217;t let them get to that point.</p>
          <p>But those aren&#8217;t the consequences I really meant&#8230; I was talking more about the existential ones. Like, I wish miss Pinkamina could still be happy killing people, without them&#8230; not existing, afterward. That&#8217;s kind of a dumb wish, I guess.</p>

        <div class='post-answer post-content'>
          <p>Uhh&#8230; &#8220;spartan&#8221; is probably how a lot of ponies would describe it. Since we don&#8217;t really have the lights on a lot, there&#8217;s no point in hanging pictures or anything. The walls are the same sort of dull off-white they were when miss Pinkamina moved in.</p>
          <p>Everything we <em>do</em> have is sort of&#8230; log-cabin-y? All the tables and chairs and stuff are wood. Miss Pinkamina&#8217;s bed is an old jokewood sleigh bed.  The tablecloths and dishcloths and stuff are all checkered blue-and-white. The plates and cups are just blank white ceramic and clear glass (she asked me to buy something that &#8220;wouldn&#8217;t remind [her] of anything while [she] was cooking.&#8221;)</p>
          <p>It&#8217;s all pretty new; the house was empty before we got here, and miss Pinkamina had never actually owned her own, uh, <em>stuff</em> until then. (You know, the Cakes furnished her suite in Sugarcube Corner&#8230; but then took it all when they left, so miss Pinkamina ended up living in an almost-barren house, not even a bed or anything, for about two months before she finally decided to sell it.)</p>
          <p>Oh: all the curtains over the windows are actually bright pink, in daylight (though they&#8217;re so thick that you can barely tell.) That&#8217;s why the house gets lit the way it does on camera.</p>
          <p>My own room is, uh, &#8220;bright;&#8221; the walls are a light yellowish color, which makes it feel sunnier even though the window is kinda small; there&#8217;s a little box-garden plant hanging off the window that I think miss Pinkamina comes in to water when I&#8217;m not home. I have a poster behind my bed, from that talent show thing a year ago&#8230; (it feels weird to finally have a place to hang it up, after keeping it rolled up and protected for so long.)</p>
          <p>Not much else&#8230; I guess we both just tend to get absorbed in what we&#8217;re doing so much that the setting is kind of irrelevant.</p>

          <p>No. She just doesn&#8217;t like talking to&#8230; ponies, in general. She finds it hard enough to deal with ponies that she&#8217;s <em>completely</em> in control of, and who won&#8217;t even be alive to remember her&#8230;</p>
          <p>Tumblr is safe for her, I think, because she only has to answer what she likes, when she likes. That&#8217;s basically the only kind of interview she&#8217;ll ever be likely to give.</p>

          <p>I honestly have no idea, Tumblr. Until about four months ago I never even thought about this kinda stuff. I&#8217;ll try to just think out loud for you, I guess:</p>
          <ul><li>
          <p>I know she doesn&#8217;t care that I&#8217;m younger than her; she&#8217;s comfortable enough doing things to foals in the playroom&#8230;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
          <p>She&#8217;s always been bisexual, apparently. She likes mares slightly more than stallions, I think, so I should be okay. (You know, I really always thought that <em>I</em> just liked colts—it seemed kind of vaguely intuitive to me, that I <em>should</em> like colts—until, um, Rainbow Dash.)</p>
          </li>
          <li>
          <p>She&#8230; I don&#8217;t think she&#8217;s ever said <em>anything</em> about the fact that I&#8217;m a pegasus. Not a word. I don&#8217;t <em>think</em> she thinks about it. But then, she might just be avoiding talking about it&#8230; hmm. She does come from a kinda&#8230; traditional? family. But I think she <em>avoids</em> being like them. Still&#8230;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
          <p>I think she&#8217;s, uh, had ponies who have loved her before. Really loved her. She doesn&#8217;t talk about the time between when she left home and when she became&#8230; herself, much, but I gather that she lived in the city for a while with a colt a few years older than her.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
          <p>But I guess that was then? She could love, uh, anypony. Everypony, even. Now she&#8217;s kind of&#8230; stuck, with the life she has. She could abandon it all and run away, but I don&#8217;t think she wants to; it would mean stopping what she&#8217;s doing, and she can&#8217;t, or she&#8217;ll have to&#8230; face it&#8230; but then, where she is right now, in this little town, with no friends, I&#8217;m&#8230; <sub>I think I&#8217;m the only chance she&#8217;s got.</sub></p>
          </li>

          <p><strong>Episode 1: Wake Night Roof Diving (Scene 1)</strong></p>
          <p>((<strong>OOC:</strong> Yes, wake night was last night. And it will continue to be last night for a few days more. <em>*wiggles fingers*</em>))</p>
          <p><br/><br/></p>
          <p>Miss Pinkamina ended up waking <em>me</em> up around 2PM yesterday. (I&#8217;ve never slept in that late before, you know. I blame you, Tumblr, for giving me something interesting to do until 7AM. <sub>Even clopping can really only last me a few hours, if I really drag it out…</sub>)</p>
          <p>Anyway, she decided that, since it was going to be one of the last few hot, sunny days of the year (going by the National Weatherpony Service schedule, at least), she would use up the watermelon we had sitting around, and fry some, uh, doughnut-kind-of-things—<em>rollkuchen</em>—and pony sausages to go along with it. I helped her do everything up, and then we just sat together on the back porch, our legs dangling off the side, nibbling on the assorted bits of food and talking about nothing in particular.</p>
          <p>The air was still and warm and humid; it felt sort of like swimming… like everything outside that yard, on the other side of that dull wooden fence, could have just melted away, leaving the two of us alone forever below the hazy autumn sky.</p>
          <p>I was kind of staring at the little garden that took up most of the space in the yard, but mostly just lost in, uh, a lack of thought. As such, I didn&#8217;t notice that Miss Pinkamina had been slowly leaning over to me. And because of <em>that,</em> I kind of had a big jerky spasm of dorkiness when she, uh, stuck her tongue in my ear.</p>
          <p>She pulled herself away when I did; I turned to look, and her head was kind of pulled down between her shoulders, and her eyes were wide and tense—it looked a bit like she was a little foal expecting to get yelled at for making a mess… I put down the bit of sausage I had been forgetting to eat for the last 20 minutes, and reached and put my arm around her waist. I smiled and gave her a little embarrassed laugh.</p>
          <p>She relaxed, and then put both of her arms around me, softly pulling me over to lean my head into her neck. &#8220;Was that… okay, Scootaloo? I…&#8221;</p>
          <p>&#8220;Yeah, of course it was!&#8221; I said, looking up into her eyes. &#8220;Mi… uh, <em>Pinkamina</em>… I was just… I was just startled. You know, don&#8217;t have to ask all the time, whether it&#8217;s okay… Don&#8217;t worry so much about it. I mean… I&#8217;ve already, uh…&#8221;</p>
          <p>She sighed and looked at the patch of barren ground cirling the porch. She said, wiggling a pebble out from the damp soil with her hoof, &#8220;I… <sub>I don&#8217;t want you to, to think you have to be that sort of pony, just because of what Dash did to you. I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m trying to let you be… <em>pure…</em>&#8221;</sub></p>
          <p>&#8220;Miss Pinkamina, that&#8217;s—&#8221; I pushed her shoulder to angle her back to facing me, &#8220;—that&#8217;s <strong>stupid!</strong> I&#8217;m not pure. I&#8217;ve never been… <sub>pure…</sub> I just am what I am. I&#8217;m a pony, and you&#8217;re a pony. Okay? We can do anything that po–&#8221;</p>
          <p>Miss Pinkamina made a sort of flat &#8220;nnnnfph&#8221; noise halfway between irritation and sorrow, and locked eyes with me. &#8220;But I&#8217;m your <em>mom</em> now, Scootaloo. I&#8217;m… I&#8217;m not suppose&#8217;ta… do… <em>this…</em> I&#8217;m trying to be a <em>good parent,</em> to break this… <sub>cycle…</sub>&#8221; she was leaning closer to me with each word, her lips almost touching mine… and then there was a knock, far-off—the front door.</p>
          <p>A high, energetic voice carried across the house. &#8220;Hey Scootaloo, it&#8217;s Ruby! Where <em>are</em> you already? You were supposed to be out here<em> twenty minutes ago!</em>&#8221;</p>
          <p>I sat up with a start. Miss Pinkamina leaned back again, starting to curl back into herself, looking almost ashamed. &#8220;I told her to meet me out on the road,&#8221; I said in a low tone to her, &#8220;I guess, uh, I kind of forgot…&#8221;</p>
          <p>Miss Pinkamina shook her head and stood up, then put her hoof out for me to pull myself up on as well. She took a deep breath and returned to a neutral, strong… facade, I suppose. She shouted &#8220;just a minute, Ruby, Scootaloo will be right there!&#8221;</p>

          <p><big><big>GTP Episode 1: Wake Night Roof Diving (Scene 2)</big></big></p>
          <p>Miss Pinkamina and I stumbled together into the darkened living room—it&#8217;s actually pretty impossible to see in our house if you come in from daylight. I yelled, &#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;m coming!&#8221; in the general direction of the front door.</p>
          <p>Ruby had stopped knocking. She called back, &#8220;hey, uh, the door&#8217;s unlocked; would you mind if I came in?&#8221;</p>
          <p>Miss Pinkamina stopped cold and whipped her head around the room, surveying, I suppose, the general state of everything around her. I don&#8217;t think she could tell any better than I could what that state <em>was</em>, so she was probably just looking to try to remember what it had looked like most recently. She answered, as we maneuvered past the random lab equipment in the living room and into the front room, &#8220;uhh… okay. Just, uh, duck when you come in.&#8221;</p>
          <p>&#8220;Okay,&#8221; the voice through the front door answered. A sound of brass on wood, and then the door swung open, casting hazy red daylight into the entryway.</p>
          
          <p>&#8220;Why is it so dark in here?&#8221; Ruby&#8217;s silhouette said, treading slowly into the entryway. There was a silence… <a href='../fluttershy-is-dead/#post-77'>and then a loud screeching snap.</a> <!-- more -->My eyes shot wide, which almost hurt, staring into the red light. A tiny, tight line of black was pulled taut inches above the black outline of Ruby&#8217;s head. Miss Pinkamina was coughing and holding her chest, her own eyes looking a more than a little buldged-out. I ran toward Ruby, grabbing her by the elbow and pulling her in. I almost hissed, <sub>&#8220;she told you to <strong>duck</strong>, you…</sub> gah!&#8221;</p>
          <p>Ruby stumbled a bit as I pulled her forward, both on her hooves and vocally. &#8220;But, I… huh? But there was nothing to hit my head on or, or any… did I do something wrong?&#8221;</p>
          <p>Miss Pinkamina stopped me. Without realizing it, I had almost begun dragging Ruby up the stairs like a drug-dazed victim.</p>
          <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s okay, Ruby,&#8221; she said, smiling, but with a definite nervous strain. And to answer your other question, I&#8217;m, uh… making <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isosafrole">isosafrole</a>—licorice flavoring, I mean. The process needs complete darkness, according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Anarchist_Cookbook">my cookbook.</a> So I can&#8217;t really turn on the lights right now, sorry.&#8221;</p>
          <p>Ruby dropped her worried demeanor and returned in an instant to what seemed to be genuine perkiness. I noticed then that she was, uh, <em>decked out</em>—she was wearing a rose-colored silk dress with subtle pearlescent trim, little gold beads and accents hanging off it on various points, and a wide-brimmed, floppy white hat with pink and lavender accents. The combination looked a bit silly, but I guessed that the hat was on for the sun, while the dress was on for the night.</p>
          <p>She must have noticed me at about the same time; she made a faux-dramatic gasp, allowing her mouth to hang slightly open for a moment, and said &#8220;You aren&#8217;t even ready at <em>all,</em> Scootaloo! You&#8217;re not dressed!&#8221;</p>
          <p>&#8220;But I… I don&#8217;t really, uh, <em>have…</em> I, uh, didn&#8217;t know <sup>there would be dressing?&#8221;</sup></p>
          <p>&#8220;Ack! Of <em>course</em> everypony gets dressed up, it&#8217;s a <strong>party!</strong> But, good thing for you, I figured you wouldn&#8217;t be, um… <sub>I don&#8217;t want to be rude…&#8221;</sub></p>
          <p>&#8220;Fashionable?&#8221;</p>
          <p><sub>&#8220;Uh, no, that&#8217;s not…</sub> nevermind. I brought you a dress to wear! I think you&#8217;ll like it, too. I <em>think</em> it&#8217;s your size…&#8221;</p>
          <p>Miss Pinkamina now had a smirk I couldn&#8217;t really place the cause of. She swept her hoof around in a grand fashion, indicating the stairs. &#8220;You shall be wanting to retire to Miss Pie&#8217;s room, then,&#8221; she said, &#8220;to ready yourselves for this most formal of occasions, yes?&#8221; (I could swear I saw a lock of her hair pull itself into a curl as she said that.)</p>
          <p>&#8220;Oh, yes!&#8221; Ruby said, and suddenly she was the one pulling <em>me</em> up the stairs. &#8220;Let&#8217;s see your room!&#8221;</p>
          <hr><p>&#8220;<em>Oh!</em> It&#8217;s so… <sub>so small…&#8221;</sub></p>
          <p>&#8220;Uh, it&#8217;s okay… it&#8217;s the first room I&#8217;ve actually had to myself in a long time, you know, so I, <sub>I like it…&#8221;</sub></p>
          <p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m, uh, <sub>I&#8217;m sorry.</sub> I just… well, you&#8217;ll see. But it <em>is</em> nice, yes! It&#8217;s so bright, and warm-feeling… it feels like… like this room cares about you, very much. Like it will be h-here for you, whenever y-you…&#8221;</p>
          <p>Ruby paused, staring blankly into space for a moment, then lit back up. &#8220;But your dress! Here, let me take it out and show it to you!&#8221;</p>
          <p>She had a large bag, similar in pattern and texture to her own dress, elegantly concealed between the folds of fabric on her right hip. She pulled from it a… well, I was expecting it would be a &#8220;bundle,&#8221; but correctly, it was actually a pressed-and-folded-and-wrapped-in-plastic <em>module</em> of fabric. It looked like it was ready to be shipped to a store somewhere.</p>
          <p>She unbuttoned the clasp the plastic sleeve formed around itself, and pulled the dress out, unfurling it onto my bed. It was a deep, brilliant cherry red, shot through in clever places with bold black and white lines. And <em>frills</em>—so very uncountably many frills. It was almost blinding. And there were armlets, and shoes, and a subtle little polished-amethyst pendant fastened onto an elegant leather string. It was all rather… overwhelming. And soft. I couldn&#8217;t help but pet it after I touched it.</p>
          <p>&#8220;So, uh, do you like it?&#8221;</p>
          <p>&#8220;Uh. I. Yes! I… where did you get this? Did you have to spend a lot for it? This looks like it comes from some runway in Manehattan, not from, uh…&#8221;</p>
          <p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t worry about it, Scootaloo, really. And I, uh, had it made. For you. Um.&#8221;</p>
          <p>As is pretty much my default reaction to things these days, I just stared at her with a dumb look on my face.</p>
          <p>And then, with nothing else to say, I said something equally dumb. <em>&#8220;Seriously?&#8221;</em></p>
          <p>&#8220;Yeah… I… <sub>is that okay? I mean, I guess I haven&#8217;t known you that long, so, uh…&#8221;</sub></p>
          <p>&#8220;No, no, it&#8217;s… it&#8217;s fine. And, uh, thanks. Really, <em>thanks;</em> I, uh… I&#8217;ve never had anyone give me anything like this before… uh… <em>ever,</em> really…&#8221;</p>
          <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s fine. I want you to enjoy yourself tonight, okay? Together with me.&#8221;</p>
          <p>&#8220;I… uh… okay,&#8221; I mumbled, then straightened and looked her in the eye. &#8220;Yes. I will enjoy myself. And you will too. I will make sure of it.&#8221;</p>
          <p>Ruby Pinch shone a brilliant, toothy smile at me. It was stunning, especially in that dress; I had a strong urge to kiss that smile from her face. But I also realized then that <em>that</em> was what she looked like when she was happy. And, if that was her happy, then what was she normally…?</p>
          <p>In a few agonizingly-long minutes, I squirmed into the various bits of fabric and donned all the numerous glamorous accessories. I was, as one might say, <em>pimped.</em> And, being ready, we stepped back out of my room, and headed down the stairs.</p>
          <p>Miss Pinkamina was waiting at the bottom, a look of, uh… I&#8217;m not really sure what it was. She was <em>amused,</em> I&#8217;m sure of that—but I think it wasn&#8217;t so much what she was actually seeing that she found funny, as something that the image of us together reminded her of. &#8220;Miss Pie, you look absolutely <em>lovely</em> tonight. Miss Pinch, please take good care of her, yes? And, oh—&#8221;</p>
          <p>She ran back into the back of the house. We both waited at the base of the stairs, our eyes again adjusting to the dull magenta light, and then she was back, holding a bright turquoise flower, freshly clipped from our garden. &#8220;Miss Pinch, would you like to…?&#8221;</p>
          <p>&#8220;Oh, yes, thank you!&#8221; Ruby took the flower, and then, without the slightest hesitation, tied the stem of it around my left wrist. I stared at her, then at miss Pinkamina. Neither seemed like they were going to explain. Miss Pinkamina, though, looked like she was about to burst out laughing. Instead, though, she swept us back toward the front door, saying &#8220;Now enjoy yourselves tonight! And Miss Pinch—don&#8217;t bring her back too late!&#8221;</p>
          <hr><p>Talking mostly—if I recall—about how pretty we both looked, we trotted along the dusty, one-lane &#8220;highway&#8221; leading down and away from the concentric culs-de-sac of suburbia (itself placed distantly from the town center), and toward the hilly meadowland where I knew, at least, Sweet Apple Acres was located. I hadn&#8217;t really been out here much, other than when I had stayed the night with Applebloom in the quiet-but-creaky applewood farmhouse. There weren&#8217;t enough ponies living out this way to have yet brought me out here on, uh, &#8220;business,&#8221; either.</p>
          <p>Coming to a small curve on the trail, Ruby veered off. I followed her onto an almost invisible path, really just a slight thatching of the grass, that wound its way up and over a nearby hill. When we got to the top, I saw something that made me nearly trip on one of numerous (frilly, so frilly) petticoats woven below the visible line of my dress.</p>
          <p>Stretching out for miles beyond—bigger and wider than the night sky—was <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c9/Napa_Valley.jpg">a valley entirely filled with row upon row of neat, trellaced vines</a>: an explosion of green and autumn-orange, with flecks of red gleaming, sultry and hidden, amongst the leaves. And beyond it, rising up impossibly from the grid of leaves, was a huge house—a mansion—in marble white and onyx black, pillars and crescent drive and all. A large crowd was milling around the front lawn, coming and going like tiny ants through the huge, sweeping doorframe of the two-story entrance.</p>
          <p>I gawked. First at everything, but then just at Ruby. &#8220;You… you&#8217;re, uh…&#8221;</p>
          <p>&#8220;C&#8217;mon. I want to show you <em>my</em> rooms now!&#8221;</p>

She told me she never realized at the time that she was making it worse. She just kept trying harder&#8230;</p>
          <p>Anyway, she told me some stuff about how long the Pie family had been there, running the rock farm—it went back generations and generations. And they had <em>all</em> been horrible to each-other, just like they were to her, as far back as she knew.</p>
          <p>So when she left, she decided to do everything pretty much the opposite of how they had done it; to break as many of their rules and traditions and everything as possible. So she threw parties, she slept with random colts <em>and</em> random fillies, she did drugs and she drank until she passed out most nights and a bunch of other stuff. Oh, and she ate tons of every kind of weird food she could find. She ate meat, not even because she liked the taste, but just because her parents said it was immoral.</p>
          <p>And, uh&#8230; above all, she promised she would never, ever have kids. Because she was afraid of doing the same things to them, even if she knew it was wrong&#8230; <sub>she was afraid that stepping into that role would change her into what she hated&#8230;</sub></p>
          <p>So, uh&#8230; she told me all that, when I first got here. And then she turned right around and took me in. I think&#8230;</p>
          <p>I think she&#8217;s trying really hard.</p>

            <p>Don&#039;t feel to creeped out by the whole wing boner thing, if you can help it Miss Scootaloo. It has become some what of a ponynet joke to ask about wingbonners or to ask to touch them, especially if it&#039;s one of your parallel Scootaloos. It not just you they&#039;re creeping on. But I think Shoulder blades may be a better comparison. Same general muscles (I think) and same location.

          <p>It&#8217;s okay, I just wanted to complain a little. I get a <strong>lot</strong> of messages that I just delete, so what you see on here doesn&#8217;t really reflect what my inbox looks like. I just wanted to show you guys one of the more, uh, &#8220;innocent&#8221; examples, so you&#8217;d get an idea&#8230;</p>
          <p>And I <em>do</em> think some (anoni)ponies are kind of obsessed with me, specifically. Not really in a <em>negative</em> way, but, I mean, I think it&#8217;s purely a physical thing for them.</p>
          <p><sub>One wrote me a poem about, uh, my mare-parts. Not joking.</sub></p>
          <p>Like I said, though, I&#8217;ll take what I can get: it kind of gives me a weird self-esteem to know that at least <em>some</em> ponies can think I look, um, &#8220;sexy.&#8221; Sometimes I feel like miss Pinkamina could never have&#8230; those sorts of feelings toward me, &#8216;cause I&#8217;m just a foal to her and don&#8217;t really have anything she could find attractive&#8230; but then I remember how obsessed Tumblr is with me, and I find it easier to imagine that it&#8217;s something else wrong, rather than just me.</p>

          <p>Uhh&#8230; that <em>is</em> an odd question. But no, I can swim fine. When I was living on my own, &#8220;swimming&#8221; was sort of the same word as &#8220;bath&#8221; for me.</p>
          <p><sub>Okay, so-embarrassing-I-could-cry-story time: one time, a few years ago, I was called into the office at school, and the mare there said that it was because somepony in my class had reported I smelled funny and asked to be moved away from me.

          <p><sub>It turned out okay, though. The first time I stayed with Ms. Rarity was a few weeks after that, I think; she gave me this big lecture on hygiene, and literally threw me into a bathtub—and I was like, &#8220;why did nopony ever tell me these things?&#8221;</sub></p>
          <p><sub>Then I realized that it was, uh, something that parents just pester their foals about in private… so I thanked her for considering me enough of her kid to yell at, haha. I kind of regret the phrasing, given that I met Sweetie Belle when she came home a few hours later, and I got to see that what Ms. Rarity had been doing to <em>me</em> wasn&#8217;t really yelling at all…</sub></p>

          <p><big><big>GTP Episode 1: Wake Night Roof Diving (Scene 3)</big></big></p>
          <p>Ruby pulled me along by my elbow into the rows of trellaces. The vines, drying in the autum air, snapped and pulled at the fabric of our dresses, leaving bits of leaves and twigs scattered between the folds and frills of my skirts. The noise from the manor was growing to a steady din even before we escaped from the long, dusty track. Someone was running up to us.</p>
          <p><!-- more -->&#8220;Pinchy! Pin–er, mistress!&#8221;, the voice called. She looked like somepony I had seen before in town, though I was uncertain; although she looked to be an adult, I had never stayed at her house for the night or anything. Maybe she was a relative?</p>
          <p>The voice arrived, borne by a mint-green pony wearing a fitted ashen-grey suit. &#8220;Mistress Punch, we&#8217;ve been frantic! Why didn&#8217;t you wait at school for the car to pick you up like we planned?&#8221;</p>
          <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Lyra; I wanted to show my friend here a better view of the place. The gardens are really beautiful in the fall, you know?&#8221;</p>
          <p>&#8220;Fr- friend? Er, I mean; hello! Mistress, would you, ah, introduce us properly?&#8221;</p>
          <p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; she said, brushing her dress straight, then courtseying in my direction. &#8220;Miss Scootaloo Pie, this is my family&#8217;s, ah, help. I&#8217;ve always thought of her as my auntie, though. Her name is Lyra.&#8221;</p>
          <p>The mint-green pony nodded and bowed in a practiced, smooth manner, cocking her high-brimmed, black felt hat for a moment to reveal the bottom of a horn.</p>
          <p>&#8220;Lyra, this is Scootaloo. She talks to me from, um, time to time at school. Which makes her my friend.&#8221;</p>
          <p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; The minty pony looked quite shocked, but then bowed again. I suspected that this was a different gesture from the previous one, but I had no idea what the difference was, or what it was supposed to mean. I shakily returned the bow, though being on all fours, I just succeeded in dragging my skirt along the dry soil. &#8220;You simply must come in and get cleaned up, then, the both of you!&#8221;</p>
          <p>She turned and beckoned us toward the paved verandah encircling the manor. She was walking along on my left side, Ruby trailing us both by a few steps. &#8220;I&#8217;m so happy,&#8221; the hansomely-dressed pony whispered, &#8220;that my mistress has finally brought someone to visit our humble home. Even if it is, might I say, a hair too late.&#8221;</p>
          <hr><p>From amid the throng of ponies spread across the threshold, quite a few heads were tracking our progress. Lyra scowled at them and guided us off to the side, seemingly stepping in behind the topiary bushes on the west wall of the manor. I followed her to see a section of wall that was slightly indented and cleared of the dried mud and muck that otherwise seemed to cake the outer surface of the house. She rapped her hoof on it, twice and quickly, and then it slid open. Behind it was standing a light yellow pony with dark hair, sporting pink streaks that perhaps covered a bit of premature grey. I think I had seen her before as well.</p>
          <p>&#8220;Lyra, did you fi–oh, yes! Please come in, milady. The preparations are proceeding apace, though the Apples seem to think we ca– oh <em>dear</em>. Upstairs, then, I suppose.&#8221;</p>
          <p>The other pony didn&#8217;t even stop to look at me as she motioned for Ruby to enter. Lyra nodded for me to go along with them, then followed behind. &#8220;She&#8217;s Bon-bon, by the way,&#8221; the mint-green pony whispered, &#8220;sorry she didn&#8217;t introduce herself. She&#8217;s just a little frazzled from the Apples&#8217; being around tonight; sticking in one-another&#8217;s taffy and all.&#8221;</p>
          <p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s, uh, alright. Do you two—live in town?&#8221; I said to her, as we walked along a darkened corridor, our hooves clacking against the polished tile floor, &#8220;I think I&#8217;ve seen you before&#8230;&#8221;</p>
          <p>&#8220;Ah, we have a little house behind the manor, actually; we&#8217;ve both lived with, and worked for, the Punch family for twenty-odd years now. The house was big enough that we used to just have a professional relationship, never seeing one-another outside of work&#8230; but, well, twenty years is a long time.&#8221;</p>
          <p>Lyra snuck past me to catch up to the other pony, who was standing at the bottom of a stairway branching off the left side of the hall. She was gathering the frills of her own dress—a puffy, swirly mass of grey with a white apron pinned down along the front. Lyra nuzzled her neck. <sub>&#8220;Bon-bon, do you think you could take these two upstairs while I sort out our, ah, guests?&#8221;</sub></p>
          <p><sub>&#8220;Oh, thank you, hon– Lyra; I needed some time to myself. I&#8217;ll bring them down when they&#8217;re neatened up. Oh—who&#8217;s the other one, by the way?&#8221;</sub></p>
          <p><sub>&#8220;Oh, uh.</sub> That&#8217;s Scootaloo. Miss, uh, Scootaloo&#8230; <em>Pie</em>.&#8221; Lyra tilted her head toward me, the brim of her hat standing firm and making me look. I courtseyed again, this time not quite as clumsily. Bon-bon&#8217;s ears perked up at the mention of my assumed last name, and she gave me an inquiring eyebrow, but then she turned back silently to the stairs and led us both upward. Lyra departed, her hooves clacking back down the hall.</p>
          <hr><p>Ruby and I were sitting together in a large, claw-footed bathtub. Our dresses had been shorn away from us and fettered off to some unknown corner of the house to be recleaned.</p>
          <p>&#8220;Honestly, why would you choose to put on that beautiful dress, and <em>then</em> walk ten miles of dirt trails to get here? Pin– <em>milady</em>, you really do need to learn how to behave properly as an adult.&#8221;</p>
          <p>Ruby grimaced as Bon-bon scrubbed lightly across her back with a sponge. I giggled. &#8220;But <em>Bonny</em>, you&#8217;re not <em>treating</em> me like one. So maybe I&#8217;ll really be a child, if that&#8217;s what you want—&#8221; Ruby said, and splashed a her hooves down into the bathwater, spraying it up onto the mare&#8217;s dress.</p>
          <p>&#8220;Oh, why I never! You, young lady, are—are!&#8221; She stepped back, flapping her white apron to get the water away from her neat linens. &#8220;You are– &#8230;smiling. Ah. Well, I&#8230; <em>suppose</em> it can&#8217;t hurt to be childish sometimes, then, eh?&#8221;</p>
          <p>Ruby nodded, her face momentarily an image of severe consideration, but then broke it with a laugh. &#8220;I&#8217;ll scrub my back—and you scrub yours. Alright, Bonny?&#8221;</p>
          <p>I smirked at Ruby, then added, &#8220;But Ruby—could you scrub mine?&#8221;</p>
          <p>Ruby turned to me, looking for a second to be, perhaps, embarrassed, before returning to her usual demure composure. &#8220;Why certainly, miss Pie. Anywhere in particular?&#8221;</p>
          <p>&#8220;Ah, um, my wings? I&#8230; can&#8217;t reach them myself, you know. Usually miss Pinkamina does it.&#8221;</p>
          <p>Now she looked certainly embarrassed. And perhaps something else.</p>
          <hr><p>Two little ladies, we were, fresh-pressed and wrapped in now-neatened coitery—put on this time, I might add, with much more care and attention than Ruby had managed herself. Bon-bon looked us up and down, then nodded to herself in satisfaction. &#8220;Alright, milady,&#8221; she said, reaching to my arm and hooking it around Ruby&#8217;s, &#8220;you look the very essence of a Punch, and I&#8217;m as proud of you as I&#8217;ve ever been. Make a good impression tonight, alright? Not as Lady Berry&#8217;s daughter—but as yourself.&#8221;</p>
          <p>She looked at me for a bare moment, and said, before heading back toward the hall, <sub>&#8220;Miss Pie, you look wonderful. Thank you so much for&#8230; for being here.&#8221;</sub></p>

          <p>Dunno.

I mean, without <a href='../fluttershy-is-alive/#post-118'>the thing that happened at the meteor shower last year</a>, I doubt I&#8217;d even be able to fly now.

          <p>She&#8217;s trying to do things on a schedule now, she said. Mondays and Fridays this time.</p>
          <p>I don&#8217;t know if she&#8217;s really going to <em>stick</em> to it, though; when she gets like this, she makes all sorts of things, maps and plans and timelines and charts and stuff. But she never ends up using any of them. She just forgets about all of it the next time she loses her motivation.</p>
          <p>I really do hope she does this time. You don&#8217;t know how much more, uh, <em>centered</em> she acts when she&#8217;s getting all those regular likes and comments from all of you. It makes her feel like she&#8217;s connected to the world, I think.</p>

          <p>So, I guess you all saw this a while ago, but Miss Pinkamina officially gave up on her blog. It kind of made me forget about mine for a while as well, sorry.</p>
          <p>I mean, she was really bad for a while; she didn&#8217;t even get out of bed for a few days&#8230; I felt like it was much more important to spend time with her and try to cheer her up, rather than entertaining you guys. Sorry if you missed me, but, well, I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re all here to read about somepony who <em>isn&#8217;t</em> in love with a wonderful—if sometimes a little melancholy—pink earth-pony. <sub>(I made her macaroni <em>so many times</em>, Tumblr. I think she finally started cooking again herself just because she was so sick of it. That&#8217;s what she gets for not teaching me how to make anything more interesting myself, though&#8230;)</sub></p>
          <p>I&#8217;ll guess I&#8217;ll leave the rest for you all to tease out with questions (I know you have more fun that way.) But I just want you to know that she&#8217;s okay now, even if she doesn&#8217;t want to talk to Tumblr anymore. She&#8217;s back to having fun.</p>

          <p>Actually&#8230; my hair kind of flattened out, too. Nothing I did on purpose&#8230; I think it might just be that our house is kind of damp inside, what with the black-out (pink-out?) curtains, and running hot water all the time when we&#8217;re dismembering pony corpses. It puffs back up if I stay outside for long enough, but in a weird sort of frizzy way.</p>
          <p>I sort of like it. It kind of makes me feel more&#8230; mature?</p>

          <p>Almost anypony you can point to would get kinda disturbed if they hear that there&#8217;s a foal living out in the woods; especially the ones that think they live in some sort of <em>utopia</em>. They overreact; they demand that the foal get brought back into &#8220;civilization&#8221; so that <em>they</em> can take care of them.</p>
          <p>But when I—er, <em>the foal</em> gets dragged back, <em>they</em> aren&#8217;t there. It turns out that making a public fuss about something, and actually caring about helping the ponies involved, are completely unrelated&#8230;</p>
          <p>I <strong>did</strong> tell anypony who I thought wouldn&#8217;t make a big deal out of it. <sub>Though, you know, I wasn&#8217;t a very good judge of character a lot of the time&#8230;</sub></p>
          <p>I told Sweetie Belle first, though, way before anypony else; mostly out of necessity. She kept her word the whole time; I even had to tell her it was okay to talk with Applebloom about it, even <em>after</em> I told Applebloom myself and she proved she had obviously heard it from me.</p>
          <p>I also, eventually, told Rainbow Dash&#8230; and she—also eventually—<em>did</em> do something about it. She isn&#8217;t the kind to make a fuss, I guess. <sub>(Well, out of worry, at least&#8230;)</sub></p>
          <p>Miss Pinkamina, on the other hoof, wouldn&#8217;t do anything I didn&#8217;t ask her to do. After everything that happened with Rainbow Dash, I think I appreciate her&#8230; gentleness, right now. Even if it is also kinda frustrating.</p>

          <p>You know, that&#8217;s a funny thought. Miss Pinkamina gets death-threats&#8230; but one day I might get jumped in an alley and <em>groomed</em>.</p>
          <p>Seriously, though, I don&#8217;t have enough hair to need brushing. I don&#8217;t even do it in the morning; I just come out of the shower and towel it off and it&#8217;s already like this. Miss Pinkamina, on the other hand&#8230;</p>
          <p>Last week—when she decided to, er, just lay in bed all day—I figured that, if she wasn&#8217;t going to get up and get ready for the day, I was just going to get her ready myself. So I sat her up—she didn&#8217;t say anything, or even look at me, really; she just stared down at her lap, her eyes half-lidded, her expression blank&#8230;</p>
          <p><sub>It makes me sad to think of her like that, sorry&#8230;</sub></p>
          <p>I got her to drink some water, fed her some bits of bread and cheese we had laying about, then started brushing her sorta-knotted morning hair back to its regular straightness.</p>
          <p>Then she looked at me.</p>
          <p>It wasn&#8217;t really a sad expression, but there was something&#8230; <em>wistful,</em> to it? She leaned over so that her shoulder was soft on my chest, and sort of&#8230; <em>nuzzled</em> me.</p>
          <p>Then she called me &#8220;mommy.&#8221;</p>
          <p>I just continued brushing, then pulled her to her feet and took her to the kitchen, and did a crossword puzzle with her. She was still kind of incoherent, but she seemed more, uh&#8230; light?</p>
          <p>She says she doesn&#8217;t remember any of this, by the way.</p>

          <p>I was just tricked into admitting something, wasn&#8217;t I.</p>
          <p>Well, okay, it <em>was</em> going to be part of the story anyway. Maybe I can tell everypony some things out of order, as long as all the details still get across.</p>
          <blockquote>
          <p>So, at the wake, after the dance (where I still think I made a complete foal of myself, no matter what anypony else says), Ruby dragged me up to the study on the third floor. She said it was her father&#8217;s office, until he died; then her mom—who had never really felt a need to go inside before—took to spending a lot of time in there, apparently reading all the old, musty botany and oenology books on the looming shelves. I had a feeling she really was just spacing out like miss Pinkamina does.</p>
          <p>Anyway, she went over to one of the cabinets and unlocked it, and inside were all these really old-looking wine bottles. She said they were her father&#8217;s personal store; not wine the family had made, but rather that he had collected from all over the world. (He was an enthusiast even before he met Berry.) She picked one, then dredged up a glass and a corkscrew from no place I could see.</p>
          <p>By this time I was feeling kind of bad for her, and for the party, and for Berry&#8230; so, uh, we both got pretty drunk.</p>
          <p>At least, I <em>think</em> it was &#8220;pretty drunk.&#8221; I have no scale for comparison: it was my first time.</p>
          <p>My cheeks felt hot, sort of like I was blushing for no good reason; and I had very little compulsion to stay focused on anything (including Ruby&#8217;s voice.) I was sitting down&#8230; but felt like I should sit down. None of it was unpleasant, though. Just&#8230;</p>
          <p>Then Ruby put her arm around my waist, and pulled me over so our faces were just a few inches apart. I could feel her breath on my nose. She was staring into my eyes.</p>
          <p>&#8220;I&#8230;&#8221;, she began, then trailed off. She leaned even closer.</p>
          <p>&#8220;I like you, Scootaloo. I&#8230; I want you to&#8230; to be my Lady.&#8221;</p>
          <p>&#8220;I– uh. &#8230;what?&#8221;</p>
          <p>&#8220;I want you to marry me. Come live here; be the new Lady Punch, Scootaloo. I know you&#8217;re lonely&#8230; alone. Like me. Let&#8217;s be together. You&#8217;re so&#8230; beautiful, I&#8230;&#8221;</p>
          <p>&#8220;I&#8230; I thought you were just going to kiss me or something.&#8221;</p>
          <p>&#8220;I can kiss you, if it will make you–&#8221;</p>
          <p>&#8220;Uh. Can I, er, uh. &#8230;no. No, Ruby, I alrhu– &#8230;already have somepony I care about. I, I&#8217;m sorry&#8230;&#8221;</p>
          <p>&#8220;What? You&#8230; who? I&#8217;m better than them, aren&#8217;t I? I can give you all the things you like, all the experiences&#8230; all the world, Scootaloo&#8230; I–&#8221;</p>
          <p>&#8220;No.</p>
          <p>&#8230;sorry, Ruby.&#8221;</p>
          <p>&#8230;</p>
          <p><em>Then</em> she kissed me.</p>
          <p>And then I pushed her away, stood up, and went back downstairs.</p>
