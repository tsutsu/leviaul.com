<h1>FERMI'S ALARM CLOCK</h1>

<center><p>A PROPOSAL FOR A NEW SCIENCE FICTION SAGA</p></center>

<p style="margin-top: 10em;">The universe came to be intelligent, no matter how you look at it, on precisely the same day, exactly 16,304 years, 29 days and eight-and-one-quarter hours ago. It was as if, after countless billions of years, someone had wandered back into the room to realize that they hadn't actually mixed the chemicals together to start the experiment. They poured the test-tube labelled "nitrates" into the other labelled "phosphates" in a slightly different proportion than usual, and set them back under the heat lamp where they had remained for, quite literally, forever.</p>

<p>Life had existed the whole time. Plants. Animals. Everything needed to evolve into intelligence was there, but it just hadn't happened. It could be that it would have taken billions of years more, and we were just all given a great, galactic shove toward sentience. I like to think, though, that it would have happened far sooner. We were all held back.</p>

<p>The Fermi Paradox, which is sort of a stupid name—it's more a question than anything—wondered why, precisely, aliens hadn't contacted us. It postulated three different answers, or rather, categories of answers: first, that we're alone; second, that we can't hear them; or, third, that they don't want to talk to us. These answers were all eminently probable: if any of them was the answer, then it would have been a "darn, we knew it all along!" moment; a collective slap on our foreheads.</p>

<p>It turns out, though, that sometimes, things aren't probable.</p>

<p>Twenty years ago, we heard the first chirps of alien communication—the "Ejo" message. We translated it and, within months, sent back a reply. It was, we thought, a nice, quiet fireside chat, between two travelling strangers.</p>

<p>What we got in return, though, was much louder. Within days of our message's departure, we heard a reply, but not in the same language, or from the same origin. Not a reply; a new message. And then another, and another. Our radio bands were soon saturated with noise from various civilizations—most of it as unintentional as the stuff we were putting out there: soap commercials, soap operas, soap-box rants—satellite debris. And noise complaints! Apparently, these other civilizations were being bombarded just as suddenly, and as heavily, as we were.</p>

<p>We found out some other things about them. They were all at the same technological level that we were. They all had a stone age, and an iron age, bronze, steel, etc. They were all thinking about "maybe building space elevators someday, if nano-tubes pan out." They all had an equivalent to the FCC that was going crazy trying to figure out how to regulate aliens.</p>

<p>So, like I was saying, the universe came to be intelligent 16,304 years, 29 days, and eight-and-one-quarter; er, rather, -one-half hours ago. All the civilizations therein developed at exactly the same rate, and started leaking radio emissions seventy years ago. The first one got here fifty years later, by a civilization that we think is the most technologically advanced of us all—and it's only twenty years ahead!—and everyone in broadcast distance replied to it, creating a cacophony the likes of which none of us—none of us here, but also none of us out there—had ever heard.</p>

<p>And so now we're all going to go and meet each other. The plans were thought up by that twenty-years-fast civilization—it's had the most time to think about this. We'll all wait about fifty years, work on our collective space programs, and then head for the center of our radio cluster in generation ships. Start a colony there, together. And, maybe, make something even more improbable happen:</p>

<p>Friendship.</p>
